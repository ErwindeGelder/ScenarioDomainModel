\section*{Highlights}

Highlights for the paper titled ``Ontology for Scenarios for the Assessment of Automated Vehicles'':

\begin{itemize}
	\item Concrete definitions of the notion of scenario and its building blocks, that are consistent with existing, less concrete definitions. This concreteness is essential for reducing confusion among experts when talking about scenarios for the assessment of automated vehicles and the building blocks of these scenarios.
	\item Ontology for the definition of scenarios for the assessment of automated vehicles. The ontology is used for a description of scenarios in a coding language. This allows for sharing the scenarios among computer agents, such as simulation software that is used for the assessment of automated vehicles. Furthermore, the ontology can be directly translated to a schema for a database system for storing the scenarios.
	\item Clear separation of quantitative scenarios and qualitative scenarios and explanation of the relation between the two. This allows for discussing scenarios on either a concrete or an abstract level.
\end{itemize}
