While some of my concerns have been addressed, many concerns remain. I will first list the remaining comments and answers and add a new comment for each one:

a) Comment to authors: Novelty: Similar work has been published before, see e.g. (Morignot and Nashashibi 2013; Provine et al. 2004; Schleno et al. 2003; Zhao et al. 2015). Thus, it is unclear what the novelty of the presented ontology is.

Reply: Thank you for the mentioned references. In the introduction, we have added the following sentences to explain the new addition of our work in the automotive domain and
how our work differs from previous published works: Ontologies have been widely used in the field of automated driving (Bagschik et al. 2018; Benvenuti et al. 2017; Maiti et al.
2017; Morignot and Nashashibi 2013; Provine et al. 2004; Schleno et al. 2003; Zhao et al. 2015). However, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an ontology
for scenarios for the assessment of AVs. From the implementation side, there are several formats and methods for scenario ontologies, e.g., OpenSCENARIO ( OpenSCENARIO
2017) and CommonRoad (Althoff et al. 2017). Our proposed ontology differs from these implementations as our ontology also allows for qualitative descriptions of scenarios, which
is useful because it enables to group scenarios and to interpret the scenarios more easily. Furthermore, our ontology is supported with the definitions and justifications of each of the
terms.

New comment: It is unclear why qualitative descriptions are not possible for previous ontologies. Being able to precise describe the novelty is crucial for every scientific paper. 

b) Comment to authors: It is unclear whether an executable implementation of the proposed ontology exists. This should be clarified in the paper.

Reply: To clarify that we implemented the proposed ontology in a coding language, we have added to following line to the introduction (including the footnote): The implementation
code of our ontology is publicly available1.

New comment: I have looked at the code and could not figure out how to execute it. It would be helpful if the authors could provide information how to execute the code.

c)  Comment to authors: The paper has several mistakes: 1. event: It is written that an event requires a time step. This, however, is not required, see e.g. finite state machines.
Only in timed automata and in hybrid systems timing information is required.

Reply: To address this comment, we have clarified that we use a hybrid-systems setting to define events and that, therefore, an event happens at a time instant rather than a time
span. However, the time does not need to be fully defined in advance: We considered the definitions of event in hybrid systems and control and event-based control. Therefore, an
event happens at some time instant rather than taking a time span. Note, however, that the time does not need to be fully defined in advance.

New comment: The authors should have provided one reference that clarifies what kind of hybrid system their model is based on, e.g., is urgent semantics used, what time model is used, etc. Proper definitions could be found here: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/TCS95.pdf

d) Comment to authors: 4. an event marks a mode transition or the moment a system reaches a threshold: This is not correct, since an event can be an external event that is
broadcast or a user input.

Reply: To address this comment, we have clarified that there are two options for defining an event and we provide an example of an event based on a user input:
Definition 2 indicates that the moment of an event can be defined in two different ways: (1) by the system reaching a threshold or (2) by a mode transition. [...] The second type of
event, i.e., a mode transition, can, e.g., occur at the moment of a driver input.

New comment: I do not think that defining terms by examples is a good idea. Please provide a proper definition.

e) Comment to authors: Also, Fig. 2 is not required to understand the difference between categories and instances.

Reply: The figure is a visualization of the text to improve the understanding of the reader.
Therefore, we have opted to keep the figure. However, to shorten the paper, the figure is made smaller.

New comment: Since the figure just consists of two overlapping circles, I cannot see how this clarifies anything.

f) Comment to authors: Renaming of existing concepts. To me, an activity is a state trajectory. Why do we need a new name?

Reply: We have chosen the name activity because as explained in Section III-C activity (Elrofai et al. 2018; Frost 2018) or action (Ulbrich et al. 2015) are part of the
existing literature on the subject. In the manuscript, we provide the reason why we opt for activity over action. To the best of our knowledge, state (variable) trajectory is less
common in the field of safety assessment of (automated) vehicles.

New comment: It seems that an activity is nothing else than a state trajectory. Since the authors previously used therms from system theory (event, state, etc.) it seems odd why one would deviate from this domain for one term. This makes the paper quite inconsistent. 

g) Fig. 4., now Fig. 3 is sill way too large.
