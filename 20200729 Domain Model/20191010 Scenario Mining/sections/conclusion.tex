% Summarize two-step approach: tagging and mining based on tags.
For the scenario-based assessment of automated vehicles, scenarios captured from real-world data collected on the level of individual vehicles can be used to define the tests.
We have proposed a two-step approach for mining real-world scenarios from a data set.
The first step consists in labeling the data with tags that describe, e.g., the lateral and longitudinal activities of the different actors.
The second step mines the scenarios by searching for particular combinations of tags.
We have illustrated the approach with two examples, a cut in and an overtaking before a lane change. \cende
\cstartf These examples demonstrated that the proposed approach is suitable for mining scenarios from real-world data.
% Improve tagging, e.g., using machine learning techniques.
% Have more tags!
Future work includes labeling the data with more tags and exploring the possibilities of using techniques that are used in the field of natural language processing.
