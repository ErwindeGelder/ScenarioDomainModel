\section{Method for risk quantification}
\label{sec:method}

Our method for quantifying the risk for \iac{ads} consists of 5 steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify the scenarios that are part of the so-called \ac{odd} of the \ac{ads}.
	\item Determine the exposure of these scenarios, i.e., the expected number of occurrences.
	\item Simulate the response of the \ac{ads} in these scenarios.
	\item Calculate the expected number of harmful events.
	\item Calculate the severity, i.e., the expected injury rate.
\end{itemize}
These steps are schematically shown in \cref{fig:method}. 
In \cref{tab:definitions}, we present the definitions of the terms that are used in our proposed method.
In the following subsections, these 5 steps are further described.
