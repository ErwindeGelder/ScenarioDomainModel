	\cstarte Scenario-based methods for the assessment of Automated Vehicles (AVs) are widely supported by many players in the automotive field.
	Scenarios captured from real-world data can be used to define the scenarios for the assessment and to estimate the relevance of the scenarios for the assessment.
	Therefore, different techniques are proposed for capturing scenarios from real-world data.
	In this paper, we propose a new method to capture scenarios from real-world data using a two-step approach.
	The first step is to automatically provide the data with tags.
	Next, by representing a scenario using a combination of tags, we are able to mine the scenarios based on the provided tags.
	One of the benefits of our approach is that the tags can be used to identify characteristics of a scenario that are shared among different type of scenarios. 
	In this way, these characteristics need to be identified only once, whereas these characteristics would be identified multiple times if each type of scenario would be identified completely independently.
	Furthermore, the method is not specific for one type of scenario and, therefore, it can be applied to a large variety of scenarios.
	We provide two examples to illustrate the method.
	This paper is concluded with some promising future possibilities for our approach, such as the generation of scenarios for the assessment of automated vehicles.
