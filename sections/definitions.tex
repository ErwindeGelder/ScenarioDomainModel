TODO: give more examples
First, we introduce the following notions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Risk = Severity $\times$ Probability  }
\item{Severity: a quantitative measure, depending on the impact velocity.}
\item{Event: actor performing a action during a certain time period.}
\item{Action: the relevant actions here are braking, and failure.  }
\item{Actor: the relevant actors here are the lead vehicle (denoted with L), the following vehicle (F) and the communication unit (V2V)}
\item{Intended acceleration,  the control output which will be realized by the driveline of either the lead, denoted by $u_L$, or the follower, denoted by $u_F$.}
\end{enumerate}
