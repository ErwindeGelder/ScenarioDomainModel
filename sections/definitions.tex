In this section we give the definitions of the terms that are used in our proposed methodology. 
\cref{Tab:Terms} gives the overview of the terminology we use in this paper. 
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Risk = Severity $\times$ Probability
%\item Severity: a quantitative measure, depending on the impact velocity.
%\item Condition:
%\item Actor: the relevant actors here are the lead vehicle (denoted with L), the following vehicle (F) and the communication unit (V2V)
%\item Activity: the relevant actions here are braking, and failure.
%\item Scenario:
%\end{enumerate}

		\textbf{Term} & \textbf{Definition} \\ \hline
		Severity & An estimate of the extent of harm to one or more individuals that can occur in a potentially hazardous event~\cite{ISO26262} \\
		Exposure & The state of being in an driving scenario \\
		Risk & The combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm~\cite{ISO26262} \\ 
		Condition & The constant parameters describing the environmental aspects of the operational design domain \\
		Actor & An element of a scenario acting on its own behalf~\cite{} \\ 
		Scenario & A quantitative description of the ego vehicle, its activities and/or goals, its static environment, and its dynamic environment. From the perspective of the ego vehicle, a scenario contains all relevant events \\ \hline
