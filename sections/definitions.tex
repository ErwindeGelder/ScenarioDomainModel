TODO: give more examples
First, we introduce the following notions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Risk = Severity $\times$ Probability
\item Severity: a quantitative measure, depending on the impact velocity.
\item Condition:
\item Actor: the relevant actors here are the lead vehicle (denoted with L), the following vehicle (F) and the communication unit (V2V)
\item Activity: the relevant actions here are braking, and failure.
\item Scenario:
\end{enumerate}
