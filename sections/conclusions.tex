% Summary of what we did
As automotive systems move towards higher automation levels, we require formal methods for risk assessment. Currently, however, measuring risk is often based on experts' judgments. Therefore, we propose a method for quantifying the risk assessment as to reduce the risk of subjective errors in the judgment. Our proposed method estimates the risk of a driving scenario while considering the entire operational situations and their relations through analysis of real-world driving data and simulations of the automation system. Our systematic approach for quantifying the risk provides additional trust in the safety analysis, as it depends on the available data rather than experts' judgment.

It remains future work to apply the method for different scenarios to show the full potential of the method. We also aim for extending our method by considering, next to the exposure and the severity, the controllability \cite{monkhouse2015notion}.
