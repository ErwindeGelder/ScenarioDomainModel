\section{Discussion and future outlook} % Hala & Erwin & Arash
\label{sec:discussion}

To be discussed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Method gives only order of risk.
	\item ``Controllability'' not considered.
	\item A lot of assumptions: with this method, these assumptions are made explicit, whereas often people make these assumptions implicit (and implicit assumptions are the mother of all fuck-ups; should be rephrased :)).
\end{itemize}


The main limitation of the presented case study is the limited amount of data used. Furthermore, we applied the proposed method for only one type of driving scenario, while the full potential can be better demonstrated by applying the method to a wider range of scenarios.
