\section{Discussion and future outlook} % Hala & Erwin & Arash
\label{sec:discussion}

To be discussed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Method gives only order of risk.
	\item ``Controllability'' not considered.
	\item A lot of assumptions: with this method, these assumptions are made explicit, whereas often people make these assumptions implicit (and implicit assumptions are the mother of all fuck-ups; should be rephrased :)).
\end{itemize}
