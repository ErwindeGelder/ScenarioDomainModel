Our method of scenario mining is divided into two steps. 
The first step is to describe the data using \emph{tags} and the second step is to extract the scenarios based on these tags. 
In this section, we explain how the \emph{tags} are determined. 
The scenario mining based on these tags is explained in the next section.

As described in \cref{def:scenario}, events and activities are constituents of a scenario. 
Part of the tags that we consider describe activities of the vehicles.
Therefore, we will use the definitions of the terms \emph{event} and \emph{activity} of \autocite{degelder2018ontology}:\cenda
\begin{definition}[Event \autocite{degelder2018ontology}]
	\label{def:event}
	An event marks the time instant at which the system reaches a specified threshold or at which a mode transition occurs, such that before and after an event, the state vector of the system corresponds to two different modes.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Activity \autocite{degelder2018ontology}]
	\label{def:activity}
	An activity quantitatively describes the time evolution of one or more state variables of an actor between two events.
\end{definition}

\cstarta
\Cref{tab:tags} lists the tags that are considered in this paper. 
We distinguish between tags that describe the behavior of the ego vehicle, tags that describe the behavior and state of any other vehicle, and tags that describe the static environment. 
\begin{remark}
	The tags in \cref{tab:tags} are sufficient for mining the scenarios of the scenario categories that we consider in our case study, see \cref{sec:case study}. However, when other scenario categories are considered, other tags might be necessary. The approach for mining the scenarios using the tags, see \cref{sec:mining}, however, is still the same.
\end{remark}
\cenda

In the remainder of this section, we explain how the tags of \cref{tab:tags} are determined. 
For the remainder of this section, we assume that the data is sampled with a sample time of $\sampletime$.



\subsection{Longitudinal activities of the ego vehicle}
\label{sec:longitudinal ego}

We distinguish between three different longitudinal activities: ``accelerating'', ``decelerating'', and ``cruising''. 
The ego vehicle is performing either one of these activities. 
According to \cref{def:activity}, an activity starts and ends with an event. 
To extract the activities from a dataset, we first extract the events. 

\cstarta To extract the longitudinal events, we might simply examine whether the acceleration of the vehicle is above or below a certain threshold. 
This approach, however, would be prone to sensor noise. 
That is why we use the speed difference within a certain sample window $\samplehorizon>0$, where $\samplehorizon$ is an integer.
Let $\speed{\sample}$ denote the speed of the ego vehicle at sample step $\sample$. 
Next, let us define the minimum and maximum speed between the current sample step $\sample$ and $\sample+\samplehorizon$, where  is an integer parameter:
\begin{align}
	\speedmin{\sample} &\defsym \min_{\sampledummy \in \left\{ \sample, \ldots, \sample+\samplehorizon \right\} } \speed{\sampledummy}, \\
	\speedmax{\sample} &\defsym \max_{\sampledummy \in \left\{ \sample, \ldots, \sample+\samplehorizon \right\} } \speed{\sampledummy}.
\end{align}\cenda
For detecting accelerating and decelerating events, the maximum speed increase $\speedinc{\sample}$ and the minimum speed decrease $\speeddec{\sample}$ within the same time window are used:
\begin{align}
	\speedinc{\sample} &\defsym \speed{\sample + \samplehorizon} - \speedmin{\sample},\\
	\speeddec{\sample} &\defsym \speed{\sample + \samplehorizon} - \speedmax{\sample}.
\end{align}

First, we assume that the event at the start of the dataset is a cruising event at $\sample=\sampleinit$. Next, we go chronologically through the dataset. An accelerating event is happening at sample $\sample$ if any of the following conditions is true:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The vehicle is not performing an accelerating activity, i.e., the last event is not an accelerating event.
	\item \cstarta There has been a significant speed increase between sample step $\sample-\samplehorizon$ and $\sample$, i.e., 
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:start acceleration}
		\speedinc{\sample-\samplehorizon} \geq \accelerationstart\samplehorizon\sampletime,
	\end{equation} \cenda
	where $\accelerationstart>0$ is a parameter.
	\item There is no lower speed in the near future, i.e., $\speedmin{\sample}=\speed{\sample}$.
	\item There is a significant speed difference during the activity, i.e., 
	\begin{equation}
		\speed{\sampleendinc{\sample}} - \speed{\sample} > \speeddiff,
	\end{equation}
	where $\sampleendinc{\sample}$ is controlled by the parameter $\accelerationcruise$ and \cstarta equals the first sample at which the speed increase is below a threshold\cenda:
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:end acceleration}
		\sampleendinc{\sample} \defsym \arg \min_{\sampledummy > \sample} \left\{ \sampledummy: \speedinc{\sampledummy} < \accelerationcruise\samplehorizon\sampletime \right\}.
	\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

A decelerating event is happening at sample $\sample$ if any of the following conditions is true:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The vehicle is not performing a decelerating activity, i.e., the last event is not an decelerating event.
	\item \cstarta There has been a significant speed decrease, i.e., 
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:start deceleration}
		\speeddec{\sample-\samplehorizon} \leq -\accelerationstart\samplehorizon\sampletime.
	\end{equation} \cenda
	\item There is no lower speed in the near future, i.e., $\speedmax{\sample}=\speed{\sample}$.
	\item There is a significant speed difference during the activity, i.e., 
	\begin{equation}
		\speed{\sampleenddec{\sample}} - \speed{\sample} < -\speeddiff,
	\end{equation}
	with
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:end deceleration}
		\sampleenddec{\sample} \defsym \arg \min_{\sampledummy > \sample} \left\{ \sampledummy\colon \speeddec{\sampledummy} > -\accelerationcruise\samplehorizon\sampletime \right\}.
	\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

Let $\sampleaccevent$ and $\sampledecevent$ denote the sample step of the most recent accelerating and decelerating event, respectively. A cruising event happens at sample step $\sample$ if the the vehicle is not performing a cruising activity and if any of the following conditions is true:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\sample > \sampleendinc{\sampleaccevent}$ when the vehicle is performing an accelerating activity.
	\item $\sample > \sampleenddec{\sampledecevent}$ when the vehicle is performing an decelerating activity.
\end{itemize}

The red solid line denotes the speed $\speed{\sample}$. The green dashed line and blue dotted line represent $\speedinc{\sample}$ and $\speeddec{\sample}$, respectively.\cenda}
	\label{fig:longitudinal activities}
\end{figure}

A result of the above described activity detection could be very short cruising activities, especially when the acceleration is around $\accelerationcruise$ or $-\accelerationcruise$. Therefore, when the longitudinal activities are extracted from a dataset using the above described method, all cruising activities shorter than $\samplescruising$ sample steps are removed as well as the two events that define the start and the end of the cruising activity. Here, we consider three possibilities:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Before and after the cruising activity, the vehicle performs the same activity. In that case, these activities are merged.
	\item The vehicle decelerates before the cruising activity and accelerates afterwards. In that case, an acceleration event is defined at the lowest speed of the vehicle within the original cruising activity.
	\item The vehicle accelerates before the cruising activity and decelerates afterwards. In that case, a deceleration event is defined at the highest speed of the vehicle within the original cruising activity.
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Lateral activities of the ego vehicle}
\label{sec:lateral ego}

We distinguish between three different lateral activities: ``following lane'', ``changing lane left'', and ``changing lane right''. 
To detect the lane changes, the lateral distances toward the left and right lane lines are used. 
These distances are estimated from camera images. 
The estimation is outside the scope of this paper. 
Let $\lineleft{\sample}$ and $\lineright{\sample}$ denote the distance toward the left and right lane line, respectively. 
%In case the distances cannot be accurately estimated, the notation $\lineleft{\sample}=\nan$ and $\lineright{\sample}=\nan$ is used, where $\nan$ stands for Not-a-Number.
\cstarta We use the ISO coordinate system \autocite{iso8855}, so $\lineleft{\sample} \geq 0$ and $\lineright{\sample} \leq 0$. At the moment the vehicle crosses the line, the distances to the lines will change significantly. For example, during a lane change to the left, the left line becomes the right line. Hence, we detect a left lane change when the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{align}
	\lineleft{\sample} - \lineleft{\sample-1} &> \lanechangethreshold, \label{eq:potential left a} \\
	\lineright{\sample} - \lineright{\sample-1} &> \lanechangethreshold. \label{eq:potential left b}
\end{align}
Similarly, a right lane change is detected when the following conditions are satisfied:
\begin{align}
	\lineleft{\sample} - \lineleft{\sample-1} &< -\lanechangethreshold, \label{eq:potential right a}\\
	\lineright{\sample} - \lineright{\sample-1} &< -\lanechangethreshold. \label{eq:potential right b}
\end{align}

Once a lane change is detected using \cref{eq:potential left a,eq:potential left b,eq:potential right a,eq:potential right b}, the moment at which the lane change starts is determined. To do this, we make use of $\lineleftinc{\sample}$ and $\lineleftdec{\sample}$, which are similarly defined as $\speedinc{\sample}$ and $\speeddec{sample}$, i.e.,
\begin{align}
	\lineleftinc{\sample} \defsym \lineleft{\sample+\samplehorizon} - \min_{\sampledummy \in \left\{\sample, \ldots, \sample+\samplehorizon\right\}} \lineleft{\sampledummy},\\
	\lineleftdec{\sample} \defsym \lineleft{\sample+\samplehorizon} - \max_{\sampledummy \in \left\{\sample, \ldots, \sample+\samplehorizon\right\}} \lineleft{\sampledummy}.
\end{align}
Similarly, $\linerightinc{\sample}$ and $\linerightdec{\sample}$ are defined. 
When a lane change is detected at sample step $\sample$ using \cref{eq:potential left a,eq:potential left b,eq:potential right a,eq:potential right b}, the start of this lane change is estimated in a similar manner as the start of an acceleration or deceleration activity, see \cref{eq:start acceleration,eq:start deceleration}. 
The start of the lane change is at the last sample step before sample step $\sample$ at which there was not a change in either of the line distances larger than a threshold controlled by the parameter $\lanechangespeed$. 
I.e., for a right lane change detected at sample step $\sample$, the start is at $\samplestartright{\sample}$:
\begin{multline} \label{eq:start lane change right}
	\samplestartright{\sample} \defsym \arg \max_{\sampledummy < \sample} \left\{ \sampledummy\colon \lineleftinc{\sampledummy-\samplehorizon} < \lanechangespeed\samplehorizon\sampletime \lor \right.\\
	\left. \linerightinc{\sampledummy-\samplehorizon} < \lanechangespeed\samplehorizon\sampletime \right\}.
\end{multline}
For a left lane change $\samplestartleft{\sample}$ is defined by substituting $-\lineleftdec{\cdot}$ and $-\linerightdec{\cdot}$ for $\lineleftinc{\cdot}$ and $\linerightinc{\cdot}$, respectively, in \cref{eq:start lane change right}.

The end of an lane change activity is determined in a similar manner as the end of an acceleration or deceleration activity, see \cref{eq:end acceleration,eq:end deceleration}.
In other words: the end of a lane change is at the sample step at which either of the line distances increase or decrease is below a threshold. For a right lane change, this is at
\begin{multline}
	\label{eq:end lane change right}
	\sampleendright{\sample} \defsym \arg \max_{\sampledummy > \sample} \left\{ \sampledummy\colon \lineleftinc{\sampledummy}<\lanechangespeed\samplehorizon\sampletime \lor \right.\\
	\left. \linerightinc{\sampledummy}< \lanechangespeed\samplehorizon\sampletime \right\}
\end{multline}
The sample step of a left lane change, $\sampleendleft{\sample}$ is defined by substituting $-\lineleftdec{\cdot}$ and $-\linerightdec{\cdot}$ for $\lineleftinc{\cdot}$ and $\linerightinc{\cdot}$, respectively, in \cref{eq:end lane change right}.

\cstarta
\Cref{fig:ego lane change} illustrates a hypothetical lane change of the ego vehicle. It shows that the distance towards the left line changes when the ego vehicle crosses the line, such that the conditions \cref{eq:potential right a,eq:potential right b} are satisfied. In \cref{fig:ego lane change}, $\samplestartright{\sample}$ and $\samplestartleft{\sample}$ are denoted by the black vertical lines.

\begin{remark}
	It might happen that there is no accurate measurement of the line distances available at a certain sample step $\sample$. For example, in \cref{fig:glare}, there is no line information while the ego vehicle performs a lane change. By using the next available line distances instead of $\lineleft{\sample}$ and $\lineright{\sample}$ in and the previous available line distances instead of $\lineleft{\sample-1}$ and $\lineright{\sample-1}$ in \cref{eq:potential left a,eq:potential left b,eq:potential right a,eq:potential right b}, our algorithm is still able to detect lane changes.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Longitudinal activities of other vehicles}
\label{sec:longitudinal other vehicles}

The longitudinal activities of other vehicles are estimated in a similar manner as for the ego vehicle. However, instead of the speed of the ego vehicle, $\speed{\sample}$, the speed of the other vehicles is used. The ego vehicle measures the relative speed of other vehicles. Let $\speedtargetirel{\sample}{\indextarget}$ denote the relative speed of the $\indextarget$-th vehicles at sample $\sample$. The absolute speed of other vehicles is estimated by adding $v(k)$ to the estimated relative speed:
\begin{equation}
	\speedtargetiabs{\sample}{\indextarget} = \speedtargetirel{\sample}{\indextarget} + \speed{\sample}.
\end{equation}
To compute the longitudinal activities of the $\indextarget$-th vehicle, the approach outlined in \cref{sec:longitudinal ego} is used with $\speedtargetiabs{\sample}{\indextarget}$ substituted for $\speed{\sample}$. 

\cstarta
\begin{remark}
	Typically, $\speedtargetirel{\sample}{\indextarget}$ is obtained by fusing the outputs of several sensors. This is, however, out of scope of this paper. If $\speedtargetirel{\sample}{\indextarget}$ is not available, e.g., because the vehicle moved out of the view of the ego vehicle's sensors, there are no activities estimated for the $\indextarget$-vehicle.
\end{remark}
