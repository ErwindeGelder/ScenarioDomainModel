\section{Ontology}
\label{sec:ontology}

Given the scenario definition of \cref{def:scenario}, which is suitable for our context, an ontology can be defined that takes this definition of the notion of scenario into account. The first step towards this ontology is the definition of a scenario class, see \cref{sec:scenario classes}. The relation between scenarios and scenario classes is defined using so-called tags. This is further detailed in \cref{sec:tags}. \Cref{sec:formal scenario} describes the formalization of a scenario according to \cref{def:scenario}. \Cref{sec:formal activity} describes the formalization of an activity, which can be regarded as one of the building blocks of a scenario.
