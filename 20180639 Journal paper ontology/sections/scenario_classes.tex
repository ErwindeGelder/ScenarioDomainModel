\subsection{Scenario classes}
\label{sec:scenario classes}
% Introduce term scenario class (i.e. qualitative description of scenario)
In this section, the notion of scenario class is introduced. As proposed above, a scenario in the context of the performance assessment of an AV needs to be quantitative. However, a qualitative description of each scenario exists. 
\cbstart
A scenario class refers to the qualitative description of a scenario.
The qualitative description can be regarded as an abstraction of the quantitative scenario. 
%As a result, for a qualitative description there is a virtually infinite number of scenarios.

% What is the purpose of this?
% - Human interpretable
% - Cluster scenarios that are very similar --> Analysis is easier
% - 

% Explain idea of a class
