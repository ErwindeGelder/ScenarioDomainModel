\section{Definition of scenario}
\label{sec:definition scenario}

% Explain section
In this section, the notion of scenario is defined. Because the notion of scenario is used in many different contexts, a high diversity in definitions of this notion exists (for an overview, see \cite{vannotten2003updated, bishop2007scentechniques}). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that ``there is no `correct' scenario definition'' \cite{vannotten2003updated}. As a result, to define the notion of scenario, it is important to consider the context in which it will be used. The context is further explained in \cref{sec:context}. Next, notions that are adopted from literature to define a scenario for our context are described \cref{sec:nomenclature}, after which the definition of a scenario for our context is presented in \cref{sec:scenario}.

% Explain what an ontology is and refer to summary of this paper
%According to Gruber \cite{gruber1993ontology}, an ontology is an ``explicit specification of a conceptualization''. As such, in this paper, several concepts are specified and their relations are further detailed. A summary of the ontology is presented in \cref{tab:ontology}. The characteristics of the terms \emph{scenario class}, \emph{scenario}, \emph{event}, and \emph{activity} are shown in the second column of \cref{tab:ontology}. The third column of the table shows the relation between the terms and other concepts. For example, a scenario class refers to multiple scenarios and a scenario contains one or multiple events and activities.

%% Explain section
%First, the context for which this paper describes the ontology is presented in \cref{sec:context}. In \cref{sec:scenario definition}, definitions of scenarios from literature are discussed. Based on this, the main features of a scenario are concluded. Finally, a definition of the term \emph{scenario} is given. A discussion on the scenario classes is provided in \cref{sec:scenario classes}. The definition of the term \emph{event} is presented in \cref{sec:events}.
