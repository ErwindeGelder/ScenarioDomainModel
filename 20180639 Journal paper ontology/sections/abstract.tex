	% Explain issue: assessment is important
	The development of assessment methods for quantifying quality and performance aspects of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is important to not delay the deployment of AVs. 
	% Introduce scenarios (for assessment)
	As traditional methods for approving vehicles are not applicable for AVs, other approaches have been proposed. One such an approach is to perform scenario-based assessment, where the test cases are derived from real-world scenarios obtained from real-world driving data.
	% Problem -> definition needed for scenario
	To minimize any ambiguity regarding these test cases and scenarios, a clear definition of the notion of scenario is required.
	% Solution: concrete definitions
	In this paper, we propose a more concrete definition of scenario, compared to what is known to the authors from the literature. This is achieved by proposing an ontology in which the quantitative building blocks of a scenario are defined.
	% Example
	An example illustrates that the presented ontology is applicable for scenario-based assessment of AVs.
