\section{Examples}
\label{sec:results}

In this section, the proposed method of \cref{sec:method} is illustrated by means of two examples. The first example applies the method with data generated from a known distribution. Because the distribution is known, the real MISE can be computed and compared with the results from \cref{eq:measure,eq:measure independent}. Secondly, in \cref{sec:result real}, the proposed method is applied on a dataset containing naturalistic driving data.

% We use one-leave-out cross validation to compute the bandwidth $h$ (see also \textcite{duin1976parzen}) because this minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the real pdf $f(x)$ and the estimated pdf $\hat{f}(x;n)$ \cite{turlach1993bandwidthselection,zambom2013review}.
