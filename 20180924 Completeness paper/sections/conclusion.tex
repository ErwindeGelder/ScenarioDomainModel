\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

More and more field data become available, but there is no answer on whether it is enough or how much more data are required. Therefore, we propose a measure to quantify the completeness of so-called activities, i.e., the building blocks of traffic scenarios. This measure allows to partly answer questions like ``have we collected enough field data?'' We illustrated the method using an artificial answer, for which the ground-truth is known, and a dataset with real-world data. It remains future work to not only look at activities, but also at whole traffic scenarios and scenario classes.
