\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The amount of collected field data from driving studies is quickly increasing. These data play an important role in the research, development, assessment, and evaluation of driving-related topics. For example, a naturalistic driving dataset is used to determine the driver crash risk factors \cite{dingus2016crashrisk}. In other studies, naturalistic driving data are used to determine the impact of the state of the driver, such as inattention \cite{klauer2006impact} and fatigue \cite{williamson2011link}. For simulation purposes, driver models have been developed using data-driven modeling \cite{sadigh2014data}. With regards to automated driving, the data of a test run of an automated vehicle are directly used to assess the system performance \cite{broggi2013extensive}. More indirectly, data are also used to create test cases for the assessment and evaluation of automated driving systems \cite{zofka2015datadrivetrafficscenarios, elrofai2018scenario, deGelder2017assessment, ploeg2018cetran, putz2017pegasus}.

For any work that depends on data, it is important to know how complete the data are. Especially when deducing safety claims based on collected data, e.g., through testing scenarios based on collected data, we require knowledge about the degree of completeness of the data used \cite{geyer2014, stellet2015taxonomy, alvarez2017prospective}. Hence, questions like ``do we have enough data?'' are highly relevant when our work and conclusions depend on the data. Furthermore, since the collection of data is time consuming and required high investments and resources, we ask are ourselves ``how much more data do we need?'' or ``how much more information can we gain when obtaining more data?'' To answer these questions, we propose a method for quantifying the completeness of a dataset. 

To quantify the completeness of a dataset, the data are interpreted as an sequence of different so-called scenarios that can be grouped into a finite set of scenario classes. Activities, such as ``braking'' and ``lane change'' form the building blocks of the scenarios \cite{elrofai2018scenario}.
