Things to mention in the discussion:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The measure for quantification of completeness is based on the amount of data and the parametrization. So if the amount of data is fixed, we can adopt the parametrization to achieve a certain threshold. Hence, this method can also be used to determine the proper parametrization of activities.
	\item Threshold needs to be determined. This depends on the applications (give two examples?)
	\item Describe how solution fits into bigger picture. E.g., give outlook on how to answer other subproblems.
\end{itemize}
