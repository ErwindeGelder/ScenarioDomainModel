The measure for quantification of completeness of the set of activities that is presented in this work is based on the amount of data and the chosen parametrization. More data might be used to achieve a certain threshold. However, it might also be possible to adapt the parametrization to achieve a certain threshold if a parametrization exists that achieves a certain threshold. Hence, the presented method can be used to determine an appropriate parametrization of activities.

The method for quantifying the completeness of a set of activities presented in this work depends on a threshold that needs to be chosen. This threshold might be different for different applications. For example, when the data are used for determining test scenarios \cite{elrofai2018scenario, ploeg2018cetran}, the desired threshold might be lower than when the data are used for determining driver models \cite{wang2017much, sadigh2014data}. More research is required to determine what the desired threshold should be for a specific application.

The measure for completeness that is proposed in this paper can be regarded as a approximation of the MISE of \cref{eq:mise}. To minimize the MISE, the approximated pdf should be similar to the real pdf. It might be, however, that one is not interested in the exact likelihoods of certain values of the parameters, but in all possible values that the parameters can have. In this case, one might be interested in the support of the real pdf, because the support of the pdf defines all possible values for which the likelihood is larger than zero, see, e.g., \textcite{scholkopf2001estimating}.

As mentioned in \cref{sec:problem}, our problem of quantifying the completeness of a dataset can be divided into three subproblems. The first subproblem, i.e., how to quantify the completeness regarding the scenario classes, can be regarded as the so-called unseen species problem \cite{bunge1993estimating, gandolfi2004nonparametric} or species estimation problem \cite{yang2012estimating}. In case of the unseen species problem, the entire population is partitioned into $C$ classes and the objective is to estimate $C$ given only a part of the entire population. To continue the analogy, the second subproblem, i.e., how to quantify the completeness regarding all scenarios that fall into a specific scenario class, relates to quantifying whether we have a complete view on the variety among one species, given the number of individuals that we have seen. The third subproblem addresses a part of the scenarios, i.e., the activities. In line with the previous analogy, this can be seen as quantifying whether we have a complete view of the parts of the species, e.g., its limbs or organs.

Our proposed method answers the third subproblem, i.e., how to quantify the completeness regarding the activities. The next step is to quantify the completeness regarding all scenarios that fall into a specific scenario class. Here, the joint probability of the parameters of different activities in the same scenario class might be considered. Although the presented method can be applied, this might be impractical because the number of parameters will be higher than for the activities. The problems of quantifying the completeness regarding all scenarios that fall into a specific scenario class and quantifying the completeness regarding the scenario classes remain future work.
