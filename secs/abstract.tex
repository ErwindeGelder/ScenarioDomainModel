% Introduce surrogate safety metrics
\acp{ssm} are used to express road safety in terms of the safety risk in traffic conflicts.
As opposed to historical crash data, which takes a long time to obtain, \acp{ssm} can be used to determine real-time the risk of a collision or harm of a certain vehicle.
% Our approach
We present a data-driven approach for deriving \iac{ssm} that provides a probability that a certain specified event, such as a collision, happens in the near future.
Our approach uses data to predict the possible variations of how the environment of the vehicle changes over time.
Simulations are employed to determine the probability of the specified event.
To make the \ac{ssm} applicable for real-time use, regression is utilized.
% Results
Results show that, with our approach, it is possible to replicate existing \acp{ssm} that provide a probability.
To further illustrate the approach, \iac{ssm} is derived for risk evaluation during longitudinal traffic conflicts. 
A few examples demonstrate that the derived \ac{ssm} provides the risk of a collision.
We provide a method for benchmarking the \ac{ssm} and the application of the benchmarking illustrates that the derived \ac{ssm} complies with the expected causal tendencies of \iac{ssm}. 
% Conclusions
Whereas the derived \ac{ssm} shows the potential of the approach, future work involves applying the approach for other types of traffic conflicts, such as lateral traffic conflicts or interactions with vulnerable road users.
