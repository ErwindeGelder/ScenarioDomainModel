\begin{abstract}

Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. 
Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution. 
Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. 
Many Linux distributions use the word ``Linux'' in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy. 
Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu. 
Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. 
Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma.
