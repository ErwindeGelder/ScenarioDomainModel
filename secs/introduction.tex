% Safety is important
Road safety is an important key performance indicator in transportation. 
Due to the enormous societal and economy losses incurred in road accidents, road safety research is an important research topic.
For example, in 2018, there were over 6.7 million accidents in the U.S.A.\ \autocite{nhtsa2020summary}, which is about 1.3 accidents per 1 million vehicle kilometers driven.
These accidents in 2018 led to 2.7 million injured people and 37 thousand fatalities \autocite{nhtsa2020summary}.
Furthermore, apart from these societal losses, the economic costs of all accidents in the U.S.A.\ in 2018 was 242 billion dollars \autocite{nhtsa2020summary}.

% Quantify safety with surrogate metrics
Even though road safety can be expressed in terms of injuries or fatalities per kilometer of driving, ``there is no yet consensus on what `driving safely' means'' \autocite{tejada2020safe}.
In an attempt to quantify the safety at a vehicle level, surrogate safety measures have been developed
