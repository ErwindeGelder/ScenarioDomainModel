  abstract = {Abstract Building on the work of Bedford, Cooke and Joe, we show how
	multivariate data, which exhibit complex patterns of dependence in
	the tails, can be modelled using a cascade of pair-copulae, acting
	on two variables at a time. We use the pair-copula decomposition
	of a general multivariate distribution and propose a method for performing
	inference. The model construction is hierarchical in nature, the
	various levels corresponding to the incorporation of more variables
	in the conditioning sets, using pair-copulae as simple building blocks.
	Pair-copula decomposed models also represent a very flexible way
	to construct higher-dimensional copulae. We apply the methodology
	to a financial data set. Our approach represents the first step towards
	the development of an unsupervised algorithm that explores the space
	of possible pair-copula models, that also can be applied to huge
	data sets automatically.},

	are represented by a sequence of events rather than by the actual
	curves. In the training phase, each cavity size represents a unique
	class, which emits its own eigen sequence. Vector Quantization is
	deployed to assign labels for this particular sequence of events.
	A Hidden Markov Model is trained for each class, using a set of training
	patterns consisting of the labels produced by Vector Quantization.
	During testing, the sequence of events to be recognized is quantized
	and then matched against all the developed models. The best-matched
	model pinpoints the cavity size class. Experimental results demonstrate
	the remarkable capability of the proposed algorithm.},

	Each benchmark is composed by a vehicle model, a cost function, and
	a scenario (including goals and constraints). The scenarios are partly

  abstract = {This contribution provides a review of fundamental goals, development
	and future perspectives of driver assistance systems. Mobility is
	a fundamental desire of mankind. Virtually any society strives for
	safe and efficient mobility at low ecological and economic costs.
	Nevertheless, its technical implementation significantly differs
	among societies, depending on their culture and their degree of industrialization.
	A potential evolutionary roadmap for driver assistance systems is
	discussed. Emerging from systems based on proprioceptive sensors,
	such as ABS or ESC, we review the progress incented by the use of
	exteroceptive sensors such as radar, video, or lidar. While the ultimate
	goal of automated and cooperative traffic still remains a vision
	of the future, intermediate steps towards that aim can be realized
	through systems that mitigate or avoid collisions in selected driving
	situations. Research extends the state-of-the-art in automated driving
	in urban traffic and in cooperative driving, the latter addressing
	communication and collaboration between different vehicles, as well
	as cooperative vehicle operation by its driver and its machine intelligence.
	These steps are considered important for the interim period, until
	reliable unsupervised automated driving for all conceivable traffic
	situations becomes available. The prospective evolution of driver
	assistance systems will be stimulated by several technological, societal
	and market trends. The paper closes with a view on current research
	fields.},

	of other traffic participants. However, if a driver is inattentive

	can lead to bad decisions and potentially result in an accident.
	A computational system that is designed to anticipate other traffic
	participants' behaviors could assist the driver in his decision making
	by sending him an early warning when a risk of collision is predicted.
	Existing research in this area usually focuses on only one of two
	aspects, i.e., quality or scope. Quality refers to the ability to
	warn a driver early before a dangerous situation happens. Scope is
	the diversity of scenarios in which the approach can work. In general,
	we see methods targeting a broad scope but showing low quality, with
	others having a narrow scope but high quality. Our goal is to create
	a system with high quality and high scope. To achieve this, we propose
	an architecture that combines classifiers to predict behaviors for
	many scenarios. In this paper, we will first introduce the generic
	concept of such a system applicable to highway and inner-city scenarios.
	We will show that a combination of general and specific classifiers
	is a solution to improve quality and scope based on a concrete implementation

	evolving on continuous-variable state spaces and subject to continuous
	controls and discrete transitions. The model captures the identified
	phenomena, subsumes previous models, yet retains enough structure
	to pose and solve meaningful control problems. We develop a theory
	for synthesizing hybrid controllers for hybrid plants in all optimal

  abstract = {Multiple-instance problems arise from the situations where training
	class labels are attached to sets of samples (named bags), instead
	of individual samples within each bag (called instances). Most previous
	multiple-instance learning (MIL) algorithms are developed based on
	the assumption that a bag is positive if and only if at least one
	of its instances is positive. Although the assumption works well
	in a drug activity prediction problem, it is rather restrictive for
	other applications, especially those in the computer vision area.
	We propose a learning method, MILES (multiple-instance learning via
	embedded instance selection), which converts the multiple-instance
	learning problem to a standard supervised learning problem that does
	not impose the assumption relating instance labels to bag labels.
	MILES maps each bag into a feature space defined by the instances
	in the training bags via an instance similarity measure. This feature
	mapping often provides a large number of redundant or irrelevant
	features. Hence, 1-norm SVM is applied to select important features
	as well as construct classifiers simultaneously. We have performed
	extensive experiments. In comparison with other methods, MILES demonstrates
	competitive classification accuracy, high computation efficiency,
	and robustness to labeling uncertainty},

	topology, geometry, and traffic activities are inferred from short
	video sequences. Inspired by the impressive driving capabilities
	of humans, our model does not rely on GPS, lidar, or map knowledge.
	Instead, it takes advantage of a diverse set of visual cues in the
	form of vehicle tracklets, vanishing points, semantic scene labels,
	scene flow, and occupancy grids. For each of these cues, we propose
	likelihood functions that are integrated into a probabilistic generative
	model. We learn all model parameters from training data using contrastive
	divergence. Experiments conducted on videos of 113 representative
	intersections show that our approach successfully infers the correct
	layout in a variety of very challenging scenarios. To evaluate the
	importance of each feature cue, experiments using different feature
	combinations are conducted. Furthermore, we show how by employing
	context derived from the proposed method we are able to improve over
	the state-of-the-art in terms of object detection and object orientation

	These catalogues cannot be directly applied for the development of
	partially and highly automated vehicle guidance concepts like conduct-by-wire

	known to the authors yet exists for vehicle automation within the
	community. Moreover, as the aim of the two project groups CbW and
	H-mode is to make a comprehensive feasibility assessment of cooperative
	vehicle guidance, all interacting components of the overall system
	as well as all potential driving conditions a cooperative vehicle
	guidance system might have to cope with have to be analysed. This
	article focuses on two aspects. The first is a metaphor-based terminology
	discussion leading to a proposal for a fundamental ontology. The
	second aspect is an outlook on the different catalogues that use
	the new terminology and that have been developed. The methodology
	introduced here is a fundamental contribution towards simplifying

	safety in a variety of ways. The development and implementation of

	traffic phenomena are modeled taking into account key safety-relevant
	processes; ``stochastic'' simulation is performed on large, representative
	virtual samples. The virtual representations of traffic phenomena
	are based on detailed, stochastic models of drivers, vehicles, traffic
	flow, and the road environment, together with their interactions.
	The models incorporate knowledge from field operational test (FOT),
	naturalistic driving studies (NDS), laboratory and driving simulator
	experiments, and other sources. Simulation serves to synthesize this
	knowledge. Large-scale, comprehensive simulations could help in identifying
	and evaluating the relevant situations in which automated driving

	Here, we consider the roles of the vehicles involved in such a scenario.

	acquired by two cameras and subjected to vertical and horizontal

	We formulate a general nonparametric estimator for such a model and

	independent of dimension. We further discuss a particular implementation

	a higher fidelity representation of the probability density function
	(PDF). Both methods require specification of either a bin width or
	a kernel bandwidth. While techniques exist for choosing the kernel
	bandwidth optimally and objectively, they are computationally intensive,
	since they require repeated calculation of the KDE. A solution for
	objectively and optimally choosing both the kernel shape and width
	has recently been developed by Bernacchia and Pigolotti (2011). While
	this solution theoretically applies to multidimensional KDEs, it
	has not been clear how to practically do so. A method for practically
	extending the Bernacchiaâ€“Pigolotti KDE to multidimensions is introduced.
	This multidimensional extension is combined with a recently-developed
	computational improvement to their method that makes it computationally
	efficient: a 2D KDE on 105 samples only takes 1Â s on a modern workstation.
	This fast and objective KDE method, called the fastKDE method, retains
	the excellent statistical convergence properties that have been demonstrated
	for univariate samples. The fastKDE method exhibits statistical accuracy
	that is comparable to state-of-the-science KDE methods publicly available
	in R, and it produces kernel density estimates several orders of
	magnitude faster. The fastKDE method does an excellent job of encoding
	covariance information for bivariate samples. This property allows
	for direct calculation of conditional PDFs with fastKDE. It is demonstrated
	how this capability might be leveraged for detecting non-trivial
	relationships between quantities in physical systems, such as transitional

  abstract = {We investigate the properties of a metric between two distributions,
	the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), for content-based image retrieval.
	The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform
	one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first
	proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For
	image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme
	for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination
	leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual
	similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD
	is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear
	optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also
	allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram
	matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations
	of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems

	Realtests können durch das Testkonzept nicht vollständig ersetzt

	However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments
	were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed
	methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In order to
	provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive experimental
	study re-implementing eight different time series representations
	and nine similarity measures and their variants, and testing their
	effectiveness on 38 time series data sets from a wide variety of
	application domains. In this article, we give an overview of these
	different techniques and present our comparative experimental findings

	validation of some of the existing achievements, our experiments
	also indicate that, in some cases, certain claims in the literature

  abstract = {The validation and verification of cognitive skills of highly automated
	vehicles is an important milestone for legal and public acceptance
	of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). In this paper, we present
	an innovative data-driven method in order to create critical traffic
	situations from recorded sensor data. This concept is completely
	contrary to previous approaches using parametrizable simulation models.
	We demonstrate our concept at the example of parametrizing lane change
	maneuvers: Firstly, the road layout is automatically derived from
	observed vehicle trajectories. The road layout is then used in order
	to detect vehicle maneuvers, which is shown exemplarily on lane change
	maneuvers. Then, the maneuvers are parametrized using data operators
	in order to create critical traffic scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate
	our concept using LIDAR-captured traffic situations on urban and
	highway scenes, creating critical scenarios out of safely recorded
	data.},
