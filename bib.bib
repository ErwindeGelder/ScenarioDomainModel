  abstract = {Abstract Building on the work of Bedford, Cooke and Joe, we show how
	multivariate data, which exhibit complex patterns of dependence in
	the tails, can be modelled using a cascade of pair-copulae, acting
	on two variables at a time. We use the pair-copula decomposition
	of a general multivariate distribution and propose a method for performing
	inference. The model construction is hierarchical in nature, the
	various levels corresponding to the incorporation of more variables
	in the conditioning sets, using pair-copulae as simple building blocks.
	Pair-copula decomposed models also represent a very flexible way
	to construct higher-dimensional copulae. We apply the methodology
	to a financial data set. Our approach represents the first step towards
	the development of an unsupervised algorithm that explores the space
	of possible pair-copula models, that also can be applied to huge
	data sets automatically.},

	A Hidden Markov Model is trained for each class, using a set of training

	During testing, the sequence of events to be recognized is quantized
	and then matched against all the developed models. The best-matched

	of the fully automated vehicles is a big challenge. The operational
	safety is affected by different dependability attributes such as

	performance,are not covered by the current automotive safety standards

	a safety analysis approach designed for evaluating the safety of

	For this purpose, we propose a systematic approach based on STPA
	to consider the operational safety of the fully automated driving
	architecture regarding different aspects at an early stage. The approach
	aims at providing design recommendations to the engineers for the

  abstract = {Traffic congestion is rapidly increasing in urban areas, particularly
	in mega cities. To date, there exist a few sensor network based systems
	to address this problem. However, these techniques are not suitable
	enough in terms of monitoring an entire transportation system and
	delivering emergency services when needed. These techniques require
	real-time data and intelligent ways to quickly determine traffic
	activity from useful information. In addition, these existing systems
	and websites on city transportation and travel rely on rating scores
	for different factors (e.g., safety, low crime rate, cleanliness,
	etc.). These rating scores are not efficient enough to deliver precise
	information, whereas reviews or tweets are significant, because they
	help travelers and transportation administrators to know about each
	aspect of the city. However, it is difficult for travelers to read,
	and for transportation systems to process, all reviews and tweets
	to obtain expressive sentiments regarding the needs of the city.
	The optimum solution for this kind of problem is analyzing the information
	available on social network platforms and performing sentiment analysis.
	On the other hand, crisp ontology-based frameworks cannot extract
	blurred information from tweets and reviews; therefore, they produce
	inadequate results. In this regard, this paper proposes fuzzy ontology-based
	sentiment analysis and semantic web rule language (SWRL) rule-based
	decision-making to monitor transportation activities (accidents,
	vehicles, street conditions, traffic volume, etc.) and to make a
	city-feature polarity map for travelers. This system retrieves reviews
	and tweets related to city features and transportation activities.
	The feature opinions are extracted from these retrieved data, and
	then fuzzy ontology is used to determine the transportation and city-feature
	polarity. A fuzzy ontology and an intelligent system prototype are
	developed by using ProtÃ©gÃ© web ontology language (OWL) and Java,
	respectively. The experimental results show satisfactory improvement
	in tweet and review analysis and opinion mining.},

	safe and efficient mobility at low ecological and economic costs.
	Nevertheless, its technical implementation significantly differs
	among societies, depending on their culture and their degree of industrialization.
	A potential evolutionary roadmap for driver assistance systems is
	discussed. Emerging from systems based on proprioceptive sensors,
	such as ABS or ESC, we review the progress incented by the use of
	exteroceptive sensors such as radar, video, or lidar. While the ultimate
	goal of automated and cooperative traffic still remains a vision
	of the future, intermediate steps towards that aim can be realized
	through systems that mitigate or avoid collisions in selected driving
	situations. Research extends the state-of-the-art in automated driving
	in urban traffic and in cooperative driving, the latter addressing
	communication and collaboration between different vehicles, as well
	as cooperative vehicle operation by its driver and its machine intelligence.
	These steps are considered important for the interim period, until
	reliable unsupervised automated driving for all conceivable traffic
	situations becomes available. The prospective evolution of driver
	assistance systems will be stimulated by several technological, societal
	and market trends. The paper closes with a view on current research

	systems in conjunction with vision guided features is the future

	of other traffic participants. However, if a driver is inattentive
	or overloaded, he may fail to consider relevant information. This
	can lead to bad decisions and potentially result in an accident.
	A computational system that is designed to anticipate other traffic
	participants' behaviors could assist the driver in his decision making
	by sending him an early warning when a risk of collision is predicted.
	Existing research in this area usually focuses on only one of two
	aspects, i.e., quality or scope. Quality refers to the ability to
	warn a driver early before a dangerous situation happens. Scope is
	the diversity of scenarios in which the approach can work. In general,
	we see methods targeting a broad scope but showing low quality, with
	others having a narrow scope but high quality. Our goal is to create
	a system with high quality and high scope. To achieve this, we propose
	an architecture that combines classifiers to predict behaviors for
	many scenarios. In this paper, we will first introduce the generic
	concept of such a system applicable to highway and inner-city scenarios.
	We will show that a combination of general and specific classifiers
	is a solution to improve quality and scope based on a concrete implementation
	for lane-change prediction in highway scenarios.},

	evolving on continuous-variable state spaces and subject to continuous
	controls and discrete transitions. The model captures the identified
	phenomena, subsumes previous models, yet retains enough structure
	to pose and solve meaningful control problems. We develop a theory
	for synthesizing hybrid controllers for hybrid plants in all optimal
	control framework. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of
	optimal (relaxed) and near-optimal (precise) controls and derive
	“generalized quasi-variational inequalities�? that the associated

  abstract = {Multiple-instance problems arise from the situations where training
	class labels are attached to sets of samples (named bags), instead
	of individual samples within each bag (called instances). Most previous
	multiple-instance learning (MIL) algorithms are developed based on
	the assumption that a bag is positive if and only if at least one
	of its instances is positive. Although the assumption works well
	in a drug activity prediction problem, it is rather restrictive for
	other applications, especially those in the computer vision area.
	We propose a learning method, MILES (multiple-instance learning via
	embedded instance selection), which converts the multiple-instance
	learning problem to a standard supervised learning problem that does
	not impose the assumption relating instance labels to bag labels.
	MILES maps each bag into a feature space defined by the instances
	in the training bags via an instance similarity measure. This feature
	mapping often provides a large number of redundant or irrelevant
	features. Hence, 1-norm SVM is applied to select important features
	as well as construct classifiers simultaneously. We have performed
	extensive experiments. In comparison with other methods, MILES demonstrates
	competitive classification accuracy, high computation efficiency,
	and robustness to labeling uncertainty},

	component is of great importance to support interactions between
	vehicles and roadside infrastructure. Previous studies have focused
	on the physical capability and capacity of the communication technologies,
	but the equally important development of suitable and efficient semantic
	content for transmission received notably less attention. Ontology
	is one promising approach for context modelling in ubiquitous computing
	environments, and in the transport domain it can be used both for
	context modelling and semantic contents for vehicular communications.
	This paper explores the development of an ontological model implementing
	relative geo-semantic information messages to support vehicle-to-vehicle
	communications. The proposed ontology model contains classes, objects,
	their properties/relations as well as some functions and query templates
	to represent and update the information of dynamic vehicles, inter-vehicle
	interactions and behaviour. This model was developed through a scenario
	enabling the evaluation of traffic conflict resolution approaches,
	by implementing a set of decision-making processes for intelligent
	vehicles. Given the scope of the proposed ontology modelling, it
	shows how vehicular communications can be used to update each vehicleâ€™s
	context model. This work can be easily extended for more complex
	interactions among vehicles and the infrastructure.},

  abstract = {While safety is one of the most critical contributions of Cooperative
	Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), it is impractical to assess such
	impacts in a real world. Even with simulation, many factors including
	vehicle dynamics, sensor errors, automated vehicle control algorithms
	and crash severity need to be properly modeled. In this paper, a
	simulation platform is proposed which explicitly features: (i) vehicle
	dynamics; (ii) sensor errors and communication delays; (iii) compatibility
	with CACC controllers; (iv) state-of-the-art predecessor leader following
	(PLF) based cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) controller;
	and (v) ability to quantify crash severity and CACC stability. The
	proposed simulation platform evaluated the CACC performance under
	normal and cybersecurity attack scenarios using speed variation,
	headway ratio, and injury probability. The first two measures of
	effectiveness (MOEs) represent the stability of CACC platoon while
	the injury probability quantifies the severity of a crash. The proposed
	platform can evaluate the safety performance of CACC controllers
	of interest under various paroxysmal or extreme events. It is particularly
	useful when traditional empirical driver models are not applicable.
	Such situations include, but are not limited to, cyber-attacks, sensor
	failures, and heterogeneous traffic conditions. The proposed platform
	is validated against data collected from real field tests and tested
	under various cyber-attack scenarios.},

	This chapter presents a ``model factory'' for socio-technical infrastructure
	systems, which can be used to set up new models of infrastructures
	by following a number of modeling steps and re-using already existing
	building blocks from other models. The approach is demonstrated here
	through application to two case studies: a decision problem for the
	location of an intermodal freight hub and disturbance management
	in an oil refinery supply chain, both inspired by the real-life problems.
	Application of the framework by others confirms that it is widely
	applicable in various infrastructure domains. Based on these results
	and the literature study it can be concluded that the presented ``model

  abstract = {In this paper, we present results regarding the experimental validation
	of connected automated vehicle design. In order for a connected automated
	vehicle to integrate well with human-dominated traffic, we propose
	a class of connected cruise control algorithms with feedback structure
	originated from human driving behavior. We test the connected cruise
	controllers using real vehicles under several driving scenarios while
	utilizing beyond-line-of-sight motion information obtained from neighboring
	human-driven vehicles via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication.
	We experimentally show that the design is robust against variations
	in human behavior as well as changes in the topology of the communication

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic generative model for
	multi-object traffic scene understanding from movable platforms which
	reasons jointly about the 3D scene layout as well as the location
	and orientation of objects in the scene. In particular, the scene
	topology, geometry, and traffic activities are inferred from short
	video sequences. Inspired by the impressive driving capabilities
	of humans, our model does not rely on GPS, lidar, or map knowledge.
	Instead, it takes advantage of a diverse set of visual cues in the
	form of vehicle tracklets, vanishing points, semantic scene labels,
	scene flow, and occupancy grids. For each of these cues, we propose
	likelihood functions that are integrated into a probabilistic generative
	model. We learn all model parameters from training data using contrastive
	divergence. Experiments conducted on videos of 113 representative
	intersections show that our approach successfully infers the correct
	layout in a variety of very challenging scenarios. To evaluate the
	importance of each feature cue, experiments using different feature
	combinations are conducted. Furthermore, we show how by employing
	context derived from the proposed method we are able to improve over
	the state-of-the-art in terms of object detection and object orientation
	estimation in challenging and cluttered urban environments.},

	Control (ACC) is an ADAS application that has high interaction with

	the ACC not matching user's preferences in all cases, resulting in
	lower acceptance of the system. In this work, we examine the possibilities
	for a Personalised ACC (PACC), which adapts the ACC settings such
	that it matches the driver preference in order to increase the acceptance.
	The driver preferred ACC behaviour is predicted using machine learning
	techniques and manual driving data. On-road experiments showed that
	the method is promising as it is able to discriminate between two
	preference clusters with an accuracy of 85\%.},

	These catalogues cannot be directly applied for the development of
	partially and highly automated vehicle guidance concepts like conduct-by-wire
	(CbW) or H-mode. One reason is that up to now, no consistent terminology
	known to the authors yet exists for vehicle automation within the
	community. Moreover, as the aim of the two project groups CbW and
	H-mode is to make a comprehensive feasibility assessment of cooperative
	vehicle guidance, all interacting components of the overall system
	as well as all potential driving conditions a cooperative vehicle
	guidance system might have to cope with have to be analysed. This
	article focuses on two aspects. The first is a metaphor-based terminology
	discussion leading to a proposal for a fundamental ontology. The
	second aspect is an outlook on the different catalogues that use
	the new terminology and that have been developed. The methodology
	introduced here is a fundamental contribution towards simplifying

	density f has even moderately light tails, properties of those tails
	drive the formula for optimal bandwidth, to the virtual exclusion
	of other properties of f. We suggest that weighted integrated squared
	error be employed as the performance criterion, using a weight function
	with compact support. It is shown that this criterion is driven by
	pointwise properties of f. Furthermore, weighted squared-error cross-validation
	selects a bandwidth which gives first-order asymptotic optimality
	of an adaptive, feasible version of Abramson's variable bandwidth
	estimator.},

	based on the time-dependent simulation results of stochastic traffic

	with the safety information of each individual vehicle, an overall
	safety performance index of the whole traffic flow on the highway
	system is further introduced, which serves as a potential traffic
	safety performance measure and resilience indicator of transportation
	infrastructure systems under various hazards. This study has potential

	in streaming GPS traces. A visualization component and an interactive

	hidden information extracted by the anomaly detection model, which
	enable human experts to observe the real-time data behavior and gain
	insights into the data flow. Human experts further provide guidance

  journal = {Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies},
  year = {2017},
  volume = {75},
  pages = {103--119},
  abstract = {The turning behavior is one of the most challenging driving maneuvers
	under non-protected phase at mixed-flow intersections. Currently,
	one-dimensional simulation models focus on car-following and gap-acceptance
	behaviors in pre-defined lanes with few lane-changing behaviors,
	and they cannot model the lateral and longitudinal behaviors simultaneously,
	which has limitation in representing the realistic turning behavior.
	This paper proposes a three-layered ``plan-decision-action'' (PDA)
	framework to obtain acceleration and angular velocity in the turning
	process. The plan layer firstly calculates the two-dimensional optimal
	path and dynamically adjusts the trajectories according to interacting
	objects. The decision layer then uses the decision tree method to
	select a suitable behavior in three alternatives: car-following,
	turning and yielding. Finally, in the action layer, a set of corresponding
	operational models specify the decided behavior into control parameters.
	The proposed model is tested by reproducing 210 trajectories of left-turn
	vehicles at a two-phase mixed-flow intersection in Shanghai. As a
	result, the simulation reproduces the variation of trajectories,
	while the coverage rate of the trajectories is 88.8\%. Meanwhile,
	both the travel time and post-encroachment time of simulation and
	empirical turning vehicles are similar and do not show statistically
	significant difference.},

  abstract = {Vehicle platooning, a coordinated movement strategy, has been proposed
	to address a range of current transport challenges such as traffic
	congestion, road safety, energy consumption and pollution. But in
	order to form platoons in an ad-hoc manner the vehicles have to ``speak
	the same language'', which is in current practice limited to vehicles
	of particular manufacturers. There is no standard language yet. Also
	in research, while the current literature focuses on platoon control
	strategies, intra-platoon communication, or platooning impacts on
	traffic, the conceptualization of platooning objects and their operations
	remained unattended. This paper aims to fill this fundamental gap
	by developing a formal model of platooning concepts. The paper proposes
	an ontological model of platooning objects and properties and abstract
	basic building blocks of platoon operations that can then be aggregated
	to complex platooning behavior. The presented ontological model provides
	the logical reasoning to support vital decision-making during platoon

  journal = {Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {100},
  pages = {289--305},
  abstract = {With increasing number of vehicles registered on road the CO2emissions
	and the amount of fuel wasted because of congestion has been rising.
	V2X and Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) technology allows vehicles
	and traffic infrastructure to communicate with each other, and could
	facilitate better use of existing resources by providing vehicles
	information about their surroundings and traffic signals. The information
	regarding the phase of traffic signal, vehicles' position and vehicles'
	speed can be used by drivers and autonomous vehicle control algorithms
	to make informed decisions as they approach traffic signals. This
	research proposes a coordination heuristic to improve traffic flow
	of CAV vehicles through traffic signals and reduce system wide emissions.
	A simulation was used to compare the system level impacts to emissions,
	travel time, and wait time of the proposed coordination heuristic
	to a single vehicle optimization strategy and baseline driver behavior.
	The results of this research suggest that traffic density and CAV
	market penetration impact the potential benefits of CAV control strategies.
	At low CAV penetration rates both the single vehicle and coordination
	heuristic produced increased emissions primarily driven by driving
	behavior of non-V2X enabled vehicles. At higher CAV penetration rates
	the coordination heuristic significantly outperformed the single
	vehicle control strategy and baseline driver behavior with regards
	to emissions reduction. The analysis indicates that at 900 vehicles
	per hour for either of the two driving strategies: coordination heuristic
	or single-vehicle optimization, to be more preferred over baseline
	driver behavior, at least 50\% of the vehicles should be CAV. Once
	a threshold penetration rate of CAV vehicles is achieved, vehicles
	following the coordination heuristic generate nearly 10\% fewer CO2emissions
	than vehicles following baseline driver behavior, a 30\% improvement
	over the reduction in CO2 emissions obtained using single-vehicle
	optimization. The vehicles following the coordination heuristic also
	have less travel time than vehicles following single-vehicle optimization,
	and less wait times than vehicles following baseline driver behavior.},

	in more than three dimensions suffer a great deal from the well-known

	We show that one can evade the curse of dimensionality by assuming
	a simplified vine copula model for the dependence between variables.
	We formulate a general nonparametric estimator for such a model and
	show under high-level assumptions that the speed of convergence is
	independent of dimension. We further discuss a particular implementation
	for which we validate the high-level assumptions and establish asymptotic
	normality. Simulation experiments illustrate a large gain in finite
	sample performance when the simplifying assumption is at least approximately
	true. But even when it is severely violated, the vine copula based
	approach proves advantageous as soon as more than a few variables
	are involved. Lastly, we give an application of the estimator to
	a classification problem from astrophysics.},

	the computational cost of the empirical characteristic function (ECF)

	a new, objective, and robust method for estimating the probability
	distribution of univariate data, which effectively modulates and
	filters the ECF of a dataset in a way that yields an optimal estimate
	of the (Fourier transformed) underlying distribution. This improvement
	in computational efficiency is leveraged to estimate probability
	densities from a large ensemble of atmospheric velocity increments
	(gradients), with the purpose of characterizing the statistical and
	fractal properties of the velocity field. It is shown that the distribution
	of velocity increments depends on location in an atmospheric model
	and that the increments are clearly not normally distributed. The
	estimated increment distributions exhibit self-similar and distinctly
	multifractal behavior, as shown by structure functions that exhibit
	power-law scaling with a non-linear dependence of the power-law exponent

  abstract = {Abstract Numerous facets of scientific research implicitly or explicitly
	call for the estimation of probability densities. Histograms and
	kernel density estimates (KDEs) are two commonly used techniques
	for estimating such information, with the KDE generally providing
	a higher fidelity representation of the probability density function
	(PDF). Both methods require specification of either a bin width or
	a kernel bandwidth. While techniques exist for choosing the kernel
	bandwidth optimally and objectively, they are computationally intensive,
	since they require repeated calculation of the KDE. A solution for
	objectively and optimally choosing both the kernel shape and width
	has recently been developed by Bernacchia and Pigolotti (2011). While
	this solution theoretically applies to multidimensional KDEs, it
	has not been clear how to practically do so. A method for practically
	extending the Bernacchiaâ€“Pigolotti KDE to multidimensions is introduced.
	This multidimensional extension is combined with a recently-developed
	computational improvement to their method that makes it computationally
	efficient: a 2D KDE on 105 samples only takes 1Â s on a modern workstation.
	This fast and objective KDE method, called the fastKDE method, retains
	the excellent statistical convergence properties that have been demonstrated
	for univariate samples. The fastKDE method exhibits statistical accuracy
	that is comparable to state-of-the-science KDE methods publicly available
	in R, and it produces kernel density estimates several orders of
	magnitude faster. The fastKDE method does an excellent job of encoding
	covariance information for bivariate samples. This property allows
	for direct calculation of conditional PDFs with fastKDE. It is demonstrated
	how this capability might be leveraged for detecting non-trivial
	relationships between quantities in physical systems, such as transitional
	behavior.},

	and various complex scenarios automated driving functions have to
	cope with, assessment efforts are expected to rise dramatically.
	In order to quantify benefits and risks of these functions in an
	efficient way, this paper describes a holistic approach for the assessment
	of automated driving by using real world driving data. Based on a
	scenario definition a suitable method for identifying relevant scenarios
	from real world driving data is described which is able to handle
	scenario specific characteristics such as the temporal and spatial
	dependencies of all traffic participants. For quantifying the effect
	of automated driving within the considered driving scenarios, the
	statistical indicator `effect size' is applied. The basic requirement
	that automated driving needs to operate within mixed traffic implies
	that the reference for assessment needs to be human manual driving
	behaviour.},

	The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform
	one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first
	proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For
	image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme
	for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination
	leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual
	similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD
	is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear
	optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also
	allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram
	matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations
	of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems
	typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the
	same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus
	on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval
	performance of the EMD with that of other distances.},

	Wasserstein distance to their closest m-point distributions for some
	prescribed {\$}{\$}m<n{\$}{\$}m<n. We also provide sharp bounds on
	the added benefit of continuous over discrete scenario reduction.
	Finally, to our best knowledge, we propose the first polynomial-time
	constant-factor approximations for both discrete and continuous scenario
	reduction as well as the first exact exponential-time algorithms

	we provide a formalized method of analysis to allow for a theoretical
	comparison and generalization of many existing methods. Our unified
	view improves understanding of the shared properties and of the differences
	of outlier detection models. By abstracting the notion of locality
	from the classic distance-based notion, our framework facilitates
	the construction of abstract methods for many special data types
	that are usually handled with specialized algorithms. In particular,
	spatial neighborhood can be seen as a special case of locality. Here
	we therefore compare and generalize approaches to spatial outlier
	detection in a detailed manner. We also discuss temporal data like
	video streams, or graph data such as community networks. Since we
	reproduce results of specialized approaches with our general framework,
	and even improve upon them, our framework provides reasonable baselines
	to evaluate the true merits of specialized approaches. At the same
	time, seeing spatial outlier detection as a special case of local
	outlier detection, opens up new potentials for analysis and advancement

  abstract = {Connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) applications focusing on energy
	optimization have attracted a lot of attention recently. However,
	it is challenging to evaluate various optimizations and controls
	in real-world traffic scenarios due to safety and technical concerns.
	In light of this, our previous work has developed a hardware-in-the-loop
	(HIL) testbed with a laboratory powertrain research platform to evaluate
	CAV applications. An actual engine is loaded by a hydrostatic dynamometer
	whose loading torque is controlled in real-time by the simulated
	vehicle dynamics. The HIL testbed mimics the performance of a target
	vehicle and the dynamometer generates the same load as the target
	vehicle. In this work, the HIL testbed is further enhanced to match
	the performance of actual testing vehicles at the Federal Highway
	Administration (FHWA) and a living lab is developed to incorporate
	real traffic information. The same engine as the actual testing vehicles
	at the FHWA was installed and the vehicle models were calibrated
	using testing data from actual vehicles. The same roadway conditions
	(speed limit, the degree of road slope, etc.) were input into the
	testbed and the dynamometer generates the same load as an actual
	vehicle's engine is getting. The HIL testbed emulates the performance
	of an actual vehicle and both fuel consumption and emissions are
	measured by precise instruments in the lab. In eight testing scenarios,
	the results have shown that the performance of the HIL testbed matches
	very well with the actual testing vehicles with about 1\% error.
	In addition, the living lab has enabled the HIL testbed to interact
	with real traffic and extended the testing capabilities of the HIL
	testbed. Two new testing capabilities have been demonstrated through
	two CAV applications. This is an exciting result since the HIL testbed
	could provide an effective and economical way for the testing of
	fuel consumption and emissions on various roadway conditions for
	CAVs and other types of vehicles.},

	between perception and behavior planning & control. Within the behavior
	planning & control block, a situation is a central data container.
	A scenario is a common approach to substantiate test cases for functional
	modules and can be used to detail the functional description of a
	system. However, definitions of these terms are often-at best-vague

  journal = {Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies},
  year = {2015},
  volume = {56},
  pages = {446--462},
  abstract = {A number of studies in the last decade have argued that Global Positioning
	Systems (GPS) based survey offer the potential to replace traditional
	travel diary surveys. GPS-based surveys impose lower respondent burden,
	offer greater spatiotemporal precision and incur fewer monetary costs.
	However, GPS-based surveys do not collect certain key inputs required
	for the estimation of travel demand models, such as the travel mode(s)
	taken or the trip purpose, relying instead on data-processing procedures
	to infer this information. This study assesses the impact that errors
	in inference can have on travel demand models estimated using data
	from GPS-based surveys and proposes ways in which these errors can
	be controlled for during both data collection and model estimation.
	We use simulated datasets to compare performance across different
	sample sizes, inference accuracies, model complexities and estimation
	methods. Findings from the simulated datasets are corroborated with
	real data collected from individuals living in the San Francisco
	Bay Area, United States. Results indicate that the benefits of using
	GPS-based surveys will vary significantly, depending upon the sample
	size of the data, the accuracy of the inference algorithm and the
	desired complexity of the travel demand model specification. In many
	cases, gains in the volume of data that can potentially be retrieved
	using GPS devices are found to be offset by the loss in quality caused
	by inaccuracies in inference. This study makes the argument that
	passively collected GPS-based surveys may never entirely replace
	surveys that require active interaction with study participants.},

	However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments

	provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive experimental
	study re-implementing eight different time series representations
	and nine similarity measures and their variants, and testing their
	effectiveness on 38 time series data sets from a wide variety of
	application domains. In this article, we give an overview of these
	different techniques and present our comparative experimental findings

	into an interconnected architecture combining software, hardware,

	system (e.g., SYNC of Ford, iDrive of BMW and MMI of Audi), Vehicle
	to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle social
	system which connects to social media networks. These systems hold
	private and sensitive information such as travel plans, social network
	messages, login credentials to bank accounts, and so on, which is
	a lucrative target for malicious attackers. Unfortunately, existing
	research overlooks the security issues with respect to this highly
	integrated system. This paper presents security issues across various
	systems related to modern vehicles through a a holistic and systematic
	view. We analyze each system components with respect to published
	attacks in details and present a synthesized body of knowledge. We
	identify the growing trend where security attacks are launched from
	the cyber space to vehicle control system via smartphones and vehicle
	networks. In the foreseeable future, we expect more security attacks
	both in numbers and in complexity. Knowing this will arise the awareness
	of vehicle system security and help engineers to build security solutions.},

	situations from recorded sensor data. This concept is completely
	contrary to previous approaches using parametrizable simulation models.
	We demonstrate our concept at the example of parametrizing lane change
	maneuvers: Firstly, the road layout is automatically derived from
	observed vehicle trajectories. The road layout is then used in order
	to detect vehicle maneuvers, which is shown exemplarily on lane change
	maneuvers. Then, the maneuvers are parametrized using data operators
	in order to create critical traffic scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate
	our concept using LIDAR-captured traffic situations on urban and
	highway scenes, creating critical scenarios out of safely recorded
