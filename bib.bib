  abstract = {Abstract Building on the work of Bedford, Cooke and Joe, we show how
	multivariate data, which exhibit complex patterns of dependence in
	the tails, can be modelled using a cascade of pair-copulae, acting
	on two variables at a time. We use the pair-copula decomposition
	of a general multivariate distribution and propose a method for performing
	inference. The model construction is hierarchical in nature, the
	various levels corresponding to the incorporation of more variables
	in the conditioning sets, using pair-copulae as simple building blocks.
	Pair-copula decomposed models also represent a very flexible way
	to construct higher-dimensional copulae. We apply the methodology
	to a financial data set. Our approach represents the first step towards
	the development of an unsupervised algorithm that explores the space
	of possible pair-copula models, that also can be applied to huge
	data sets automatically.},

	class, which emits its own eigen sequence. Vector Quantization is
	deployed to assign labels for this particular sequence of events.
	A Hidden Markov Model is trained for each class, using a set of training
	patterns consisting of the labels produced by Vector Quantization.
	During testing, the sequence of events to be recognized is quantized
	and then matched against all the developed models. The best-matched
	model pinpoints the cavity size class. Experimental results demonstrate

	Each benchmark is composed by a vehicle model, a cost function, and
	a scenario (including goals and constraints). The scenarios are partly
	recorded from real traffic and partly hand-crafted to create dangerous

	a fundamental desire of mankind. Virtually any society strives for
	safe and efficient mobility at low ecological and economic costs.
	Nevertheless, its technical implementation significantly differs
	among societies, depending on their culture and their degree of industrialization.
	A potential evolutionary roadmap for driver assistance systems is
	discussed. Emerging from systems based on proprioceptive sensors,
	such as ABS or ESC, we review the progress incented by the use of
	exteroceptive sensors such as radar, video, or lidar. While the ultimate
	goal of automated and cooperative traffic still remains a vision
	of the future, intermediate steps towards that aim can be realized
	through systems that mitigate or avoid collisions in selected driving
	situations. Research extends the state-of-the-art in automated driving
	in urban traffic and in cooperative driving, the latter addressing
	communication and collaboration between different vehicles, as well
	as cooperative vehicle operation by its driver and its machine intelligence.
	These steps are considered important for the interim period, until
	reliable unsupervised automated driving for all conceivable traffic
	situations becomes available. The prospective evolution of driver
	assistance systems will be stimulated by several technological, societal
	and market trends. The paper closes with a view on current research

	of other traffic participants. However, if a driver is inattentive

	A computational system that is designed to anticipate other traffic
	participants' behaviors could assist the driver in his decision making
	by sending him an early warning when a risk of collision is predicted.
	Existing research in this area usually focuses on only one of two
	aspects, i.e., quality or scope. Quality refers to the ability to
	warn a driver early before a dangerous situation happens. Scope is
	the diversity of scenarios in which the approach can work. In general,
	we see methods targeting a broad scope but showing low quality, with
	others having a narrow scope but high quality. Our goal is to create
	a system with high quality and high scope. To achieve this, we propose
	an architecture that combines classifiers to predict behaviors for
	many scenarios. In this paper, we will first introduce the generic
	concept of such a system applicable to highway and inner-city scenarios.
	We will show that a combination of general and specific classifiers

  abstract = {Multiple-instance problems arise from the situations where training
	class labels are attached to sets of samples (named bags), instead
	of individual samples within each bag (called instances). Most previous
	multiple-instance learning (MIL) algorithms are developed based on
	the assumption that a bag is positive if and only if at least one
	of its instances is positive. Although the assumption works well
	in a drug activity prediction problem, it is rather restrictive for
	other applications, especially those in the computer vision area.
	We propose a learning method, MILES (multiple-instance learning via
	embedded instance selection), which converts the multiple-instance
	learning problem to a standard supervised learning problem that does
	not impose the assumption relating instance labels to bag labels.
	MILES maps each bag into a feature space defined by the instances
	in the training bags via an instance similarity measure. This feature
	mapping often provides a large number of redundant or irrelevant
	features. Hence, 1-norm SVM is applied to select important features
	as well as construct classifiers simultaneously. We have performed
	extensive experiments. In comparison with other methods, MILES demonstrates
	competitive classification accuracy, high computation efficiency,
	and robustness to labeling uncertainty},

	vehicle guidance, all interacting components of the overall system

	guidance system might have to cope with have to be analysed. This

	discussion leading to a proposal for a fundamental ontology. The

	the new terminology and that have been developed. The methodology

	safety-relevant functions require prospective, quantitative assessment

	traffic phenomena are modeled taking into account key safety-relevant
	processes; ``stochastic'' simulation is performed on large, representative
	virtual samples. The virtual representations of traffic phenomena
	are based on detailed, stochastic models of drivers, vehicles, traffic
	flow, and the road environment, together with their interactions.
	The models incorporate knowledge from field operational test (FOT),
	naturalistic driving studies (NDS), laboratory and driving simulator
	experiments, and other sources. Simulation serves to synthesize this
	knowledge. Large-scale, comprehensive simulations could help in identifying
	and evaluating the relevant situations in which automated driving
	impacts traffic safety. One key objective is a standardized harmonized

	behavior of vehicles travelling in front and behind of a driver (overtaken)
	car. Following distance of vehicles moving in front and at rear end
	of the car in question plays an important role for overtaking scenario.
	Moreover, the distance between the car in front and the vehicle following
	it should be sufficiently long for preventing collision if overtaking
	is inevitable for the motorist behind the middle subject vehicle.
	Here, we consider the roles of the vehicles involved in such a scenario.
	We observe the behaviors of moving vehicles in front and the rear
	end of the subject car. To this end, front and rear car images are
	acquired by two cameras and subjected to vertical and horizontal
	optical flow edge map creation. In classification stage of the optical
	flow edge map clusters, a motion vector histogram thresholding method
	is utilized in conjunction with a decision assessment strategy based
	on the joint Bayesian belief network statistical model. In turn,
	not only the trajectories of the cars are captured but also joint
	behavior of three cars over-taken scenario is estimated using the
	proposed interactive risk model.},

  abstract = {This article introduces a novel approach towards the recognition of
	typical driving maneuvers in structured highway scenarios and shows
	some key benefits of traffic scene modeling with object-oriented
	Bayesian networks (OOBNs). The approach exploits the advantages of
	an introduced lane-related coordinate system together with individual
	occupancy schedule grids for all modeled vehicles. This combination
	allows an efficient classification of the existing vehicle-lane and
	vehicle- vehicle relations in traffic scenes and thus substantially
	improves the understanding of complex traffic scenes. Probabilities
	and variances within the network are propagated systematically which
	results in probabilistic sets of the modeled driving maneuvers. Using
	this generic approach, the network is able to classify a total of
	27 driving maneuvers including merging and object following.},

	call for the estimation of probability densities. Histograms and
	kernel density estimates (KDEs) are two commonly used techniques
	for estimating such information, with the KDE generally providing
	a higher fidelity representation of the probability density function
	(PDF). Both methods require specification of either a bin width or
	a kernel bandwidth. While techniques exist for choosing the kernel
	bandwidth optimally and objectively, they are computationally intensive,
	since they require repeated calculation of the KDE. A solution for
	objectively and optimally choosing both the kernel shape and width
	has recently been developed by Bernacchia and Pigolotti (2011). While
	this solution theoretically applies to multidimensional KDEs, it
	has not been clear how to practically do so. A method for practically
	extending the Bernacchiaâ€“Pigolotti KDE to multidimensions is introduced.
	This multidimensional extension is combined with a recently-developed
	computational improvement to their method that makes it computationally
	efficient: a 2D KDE on 105 samples only takes 1Â s on a modern workstation.
	This fast and objective KDE method, called the fastKDE method, retains
	the excellent statistical convergence properties that have been demonstrated
	for univariate samples. The fastKDE method exhibits statistical accuracy
	that is comparable to state-of-the-science KDE methods publicly available
	in R, and it produces kernel density estimates several orders of
	magnitude faster. The fastKDE method does an excellent job of encoding
	covariance information for bivariate samples. This property allows
	for direct calculation of conditional PDFs with fastKDE. It is demonstrated
	how this capability might be leveraged for detecting non-trivial
	relationships between quantities in physical systems, such as transitional
	behavior.},

	proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For
	image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme

	leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual
	similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD
	is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear
	optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also
	allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram
	matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations
	of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems
	typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the
	same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus
	on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval
	performance of the EMD with that of other distances.},

	das Testverfahren praxisnah angewendet. Hierzu werden exemplarisch
	aus den beiden Forschungsprojekten UR:BAN-KA und Stadtpilot verschiedene
	Teilfunktionen herangezogen. Das Konzept testet die Assistenzsysteme
	durch eine Vielzahl von verschiedenen Szenarien, die sich hinsichtlich
	einzelner Faktoren voneinander unterscheiden. Hierzu gehören unter
	anderem verschiedenste Straßengeometrien und -topologien, Verkehrssituationen
	sowie Umwelteinflüsse. Die einzelnen Parameter der Szenarien werden
	durch kombinatorische Verfahren variiert und auf diese Weise redundanzarme
	effiziente Testfälle erzeugt. Das Konzept umfasst ebenfalls eine
	simulationsgestützte automatisierte Testdurchführung und -auswertung.
	Realtests können durch das Testkonzept nicht vollständig ersetzt

	erheblich zu reduzieren. Somit können schon zahlreiche Tests in einer
