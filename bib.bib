  abstract = {An approach for the classification of cavity sizes based on their
	maximum charge transfer characteristics, applied voltage partial
	discharge pattern using Hidden Markov Models, is described. In these
	models, the partial discharge patterns for different cavity sizes
	are represented by a sequence of events rather than by the actual
	curves. In the training phase, each cavity size represents a unique
	class, which emits its own eigen sequence. Vector Quantization is
	deployed to assign labels for this particular sequence of events.
	A Hidden Markov Model is trained for each class, using a set of training
	patterns consisting of the labels produced by Vector Quantization.
	During testing, the sequence of events to be recognized is quantized
	and then matched against all the developed models. The best-matched
	model pinpoints the cavity size class. Experimental results demonstrate
	the remarkable capability of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {Before taking a decision, a driver anticipates the future behavior
	of other traffic participants. However, if a driver is inattentive
	or overloaded, he may fail to consider relevant information. This
	can lead to bad decisions and potentially result in an accident.
	A computational system that is designed to anticipate other traffic
	participants' behaviors could assist the driver in his decision making
	by sending him an early warning when a risk of collision is predicted.
	Existing research in this area usually focuses on only one of two
	aspects, i.e., quality or scope. Quality refers to the ability to
	warn a driver early before a dangerous situation happens. Scope is
	the diversity of scenarios in which the approach can work. In general,
	we see methods targeting a broad scope but showing low quality, with
	others having a narrow scope but high quality. Our goal is to create
	a system with high quality and high scope. To achieve this, we propose
	an architecture that combines classifiers to predict behaviors for
	many scenarios. In this paper, we will first introduce the generic
	concept of such a system applicable to highway and inner-city scenarios.
	We will show that a combination of general and specific classifiers
	is a solution to improve quality and scope based on a concrete implementation
	for lane-change prediction in highway scenarios.},

	a hybrid system, combining differential equations and automata, governed

	of hybrid systems as interacting collections of dynamical systems,
	evolving on continuous-variable state spaces and subject to continuous
	controls and discrete transitions. The model captures the identified
	phenomena, subsumes previous models, yet retains enough structure
	to pose and solve meaningful control problems. We develop a theory
	for synthesizing hybrid controllers for hybrid plants in all optimal
	control framework. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of
	optimal (relaxed) and near-optimal (precise) controls and derive
	“generalized quasi-variational inequalities�? that the associated
	value function satisfies. We summarize algorithms for solving these
	inequalities based on a generalized Bellman equation, impulse control,

  abstract = {Multiple-instance problems arise from the situations where training
	class labels are attached to sets of samples (named bags), instead
	of individual samples within each bag (called instances). Most previous
	multiple-instance learning (MIL) algorithms are developed based on
	the assumption that a bag is positive if and only if at least one
	of its instances is positive. Although the assumption works well
	in a drug activity prediction problem, it is rather restrictive for
	other applications, especially those in the computer vision area.
	We propose a learning method, MILES (multiple-instance learning via
	embedded instance selection), which converts the multiple-instance
	learning problem to a standard supervised learning problem that does
	not impose the assumption relating instance labels to bag labels.
	MILES maps each bag into a feature space defined by the instances
	in the training bags via an instance similarity measure. This feature
	mapping often provides a large number of redundant or irrelevant
	features. Hence, 1-norm SVM is applied to select important features
	as well as construct classifiers simultaneously. We have performed
	extensive experiments. In comparison with other methods, MILES demonstrates
	competitive classification accuracy, high computation efficiency,
	and robustness to labeling uncertainty},

	Moreover, the distance between the car in front and the vehicle following

	Here, we consider the roles of the vehicles involved in such a scenario.
	We observe the behaviors of moving vehicles in front and the rear
	end of the subject car. To this end, front and rear car images are
	acquired by two cameras and subjected to vertical and horizontal
	optical flow edge map creation. In classification stage of the optical
	flow edge map clusters, a motion vector histogram thresholding method
	is utilized in conjunction with a decision assessment strategy based

  abstract = {This tutorial provides an overview of the basic theory of hidden Markov
	models (HMMs) as originated by L.E. Baum and T. Petrie (1966) and
	gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory
	along with a description of selected applications of the theory to
	distinct problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of
	original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring
	the background required to pursue further this area of research.
	The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and
	shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is
	a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The
	theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing,
	and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems
	of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these

	a certain degree settled already, they are quite vague in the consecutive
	steps of context modeling and in particular on the side of driving
	execution. The authors consider the scene as the central interface
	between perception and behavior planning & control. Within the behavior
	planning & control block, a situation is a central data container.
	A scenario is a common approach to substantiate test cases for functional
	modules and can be used to detail the functional description of a
	system. However, definitions of these terms are often-at best-vague
	or even contradictory. This paper will review these definitions and
	come up with a consistent definition for each term. Moreover, we
	present an example for the implementation of each of these interfaces.},

	We demonstrate our concept at the example of parametrizing lane change

	observed vehicle trajectories. The road layout is then used in order
	to detect vehicle maneuvers, which is shown exemplarily on lane change
	maneuvers. Then, the maneuvers are parametrized using data operators
	in order to create critical traffic scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate
	our concept using LIDAR-captured traffic situations on urban and
	highway scenes, creating critical scenarios out of safely recorded
