The performance assessment of AVs is important for the legal and public acceptance of AVs. Since test scenarios are crucial for the assessment, the clear definition of a scenario is required within this context. As such, we presented the definition of a scenario in the context of the assessment of an AV's performance. The definition states that a scenario is a quantitative description of the ego vehicle, its activities and/or goals, its static environment and its dynamic environment. The attributes of a scenario are further specified. The presented definitions are applicable for scenario mining and scenario-based assessment and therefore, it provides a step towards the scenario-based performance assessment of AVs.
