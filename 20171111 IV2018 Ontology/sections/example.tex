\section{Application example}
\label{sec:example}

To illustrate the ontology, a real-world example is presented. A schematic overview of the example is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:example schematic}. Two vehicles are considered: a pickup truck and a sedan. The example can be described in words as follows. The ego vehicle (i.e., the sedan) accelerates towards its predecessor (i.e., the pickup truck), such that the distance between the ego vehicle and its predecessor becomes smaller. At some point, the ego vehicle brakes, such that it reaches approximately the same speed as the pickup truck's speed. From then on, the ego vehicle cruises, such that the distance between the two vehicles remains approximately constant. The pickup truck drives at a constant speed.

In the presented example, two scenarios are identified. The scenarios can be qualitatively described as `gap-closing on rural road with clear weather' and `cruising behind target vehicle on rural road with clear weather', respectively. The first scenario ends when the ego vehicle starts cruising. 
% Note that, when testing an AV, the first scenario might end later in case it takes longer for the AV to start the cruising activity.

The activities of the ego vehicle are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example ego states}, in which the speed is shown with respect to time $t$. Regarding the speed, two events are identified. At the first event, the ego vehicle's longitudinal acceleration transits from being positive to negative, i.e., the ego vehicle starts braking. As there are two events identified regarding the speed, three different activities are to be modeled, qualitatively described as `accelerating', `braking', and `cruising', respectively.

Whereas the definitions from Geyer~et~al.~\cite{geyer2014}, Ulbrich~et~al.~\cite{ulbrich2015}, and Elrofai~et~al.~\cite{elrofai2016scenario} do not state when a scenario ends, \cref{def:scenario} states that a scenario contains all the relevant events.

%Figure~\ref{fig:example dynamic environment} shows the longitudinal and lateral position of the pickup truck and the station wagon with respect to the ego vehicle. The station wagon accelerates and performs a lane change at approximately $t\approx10$ s. At $t\approx12$ s, the station wagon overtakes the ego vehicle. The ego vehicle overtakes the pickup truck at $t\approx25$ s, as can be seen by the relative longitudinal distance of the pickup truck in Figure~\ref{fig:example dynamic environment}a, which becomes negative at $t\approx25$ s. The events related to the pickup truck and the station wagon are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example events}. Here, it can be seen that the pickup truck is in the field of view of the ego vehicle's sensors from $t=1$ s until $t=34$ s. The station wagon is in the field of view of the ego vehicle's sensors from $t=0$ s until $t=18$ s.
