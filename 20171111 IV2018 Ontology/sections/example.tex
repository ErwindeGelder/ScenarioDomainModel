\section{Application example}
\label{sec:example}

To illustrate the ontology, an real-life example is presented. A schematic overview of the example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example schematic}. Three vehicles are present in the example, a pickup truck, a sedan, and a station wagon, see Figure~\ref{fig:example schematic}a from left to right, respectively. The ego vehicle, i.e., the sedan, is displayed in red. The example can be described in words as follows. The ego vehicle accelerate towards its predecessor (i.e., the pickup truck), such that it ends up following it with an approximately constant distance. In the meantime, the car behind the ego vehicle (i.e., the station wagon) accelerates and takes over both other vehicles (i.e., the ego vehicle and the pickup truck). When the station wagon passed both vehicles, the ego vehicle accelerates and performs a lane change after which it overtakes the pickup truck.

Two different scenarios can be identified. The first scenario starts at the beginning of the example and ends when the lane change start. When the first scenario ends, the second scenario starts until. The second scenario ends when the ego vehicle completes the overtaking of the pickup truck.
