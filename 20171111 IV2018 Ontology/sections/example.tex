\section{Application example}
\label{sec:example}

To illustrate the ontology, a real-life example is presented. A schematic overview of the example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example schematic}. Three vehicles are present in the example: a pickup truck, a sedan, and a station wagon, see Figure~\ref{fig:example schematic}a from left to right, respectively. The ego vehicle, i.e., the sedan, is displayed in red. The example can be described in words as follows. The ego vehicle accelerates towards its predecessor (i.e., the pickup truck), such that the distance between the ego vehicle and its predecessor becomes smaller. In the meantime, the car behind the ego vehicle (i.e., the station wagon) accelerates and takes over both other vehicles (i.e., the ego vehicle and the pickup truck). When the station wagon has passed both vehicles, the ego vehicle accelerates and performs a lane change after which it overtakes the pickup truck.

\end{figure}

Two different scenarios can be identified. The first scenario starts at the beginning of the example and ends when the lane change starts. When the first scenario ends, the second scenario starts. The second scenario ends when the ego vehicle completes the overtaking of the pickup truck.

The activities of the ego vehicle are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example ego states}, in which the longitudinal velocity and lateral position are shown with respect to time $t$. Here, the longitudinal and lateral positions are expressed in the Road Coordinate System \cite{zofka2015datadrivetrafficscenarios}. Regarding the longitudinal velocity, four events are identified. At the first event, the ego vehicle's longitudinal acceleration transits from being positive to negative, i.e., the ego vehicle starts braking. As there are four events identified regarding the longitudinal velocity, five different activities are to be modeled, denoted by A, B, C, D, and E in Figure~\ref{fig:example ego states}a. During the time intervals A, B, C, D, and E, the ego vehicle accelerates, brakes, cruises, accelerates, and cruises, respectively. Regarding the lateral position, see Figure~\ref{fig:example ego states}b, also four events are identified, such that at each event time the ego vehicle starts or completes a lane change. During the second and fourth activity (i.e., time intervals G and I in Figure~\ref{fig:example ego states}b) the ego vehicle performs the lane change, while in the remaining time (i.e., time intervals F, H and J in Figure~\ref{fig:example ego states}b) the ego vehicles drives straight ahead. An complete overview of the events is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:example events}.

Figure~\ref{fig:example dynamic environment} shows the longitudinal and lateral position of the pickup truck and the station wagon with respect to the ego vehicle. The station wagon accelerates and performs a lane change at approximately $t\approx10$ s. At $t\approx12$ s, the station wagon overtakes the ego vehicle. The ego vehicle overtakes the pickup truck at $t\approx25$ s, as can be seen by the relative longitudinal distance of the pickup truck in Figure~\ref{fig:example dynamic environment}a, which becomes negative at $t\approx25$ s. The events related to the pickup truck and the station wagon are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example events}. Here, it can be seen that the pickup truck is in the field of view of the ego vehicle's sensors from $t=1$ s until $t=34$ s. The station wagon is in the field of view of the ego vehicle's sensors from $t=0$ s until $t=18$ s.
