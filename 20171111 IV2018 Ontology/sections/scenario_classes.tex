\subsection{Scenario classes}
\label{sec:scenario classes}
% Introduce term scenario class (i.e. qualitative description of scenario)
In this section, the notion of scenario class is introduced. As proposed above, a scenario in the context of the performance assessment of an AV needs to be quantitative. There exists, however, a qualitative description of each scenario. The qualitative description can be regarded as an abstraction of the quantitative scenario. As a result, for a qualitative description there may be an infinite amount of scenarios. A scenario class is a qualitative description of a scenario. 

% Name different names of traffic scenarios in literature
In literature, many different types of scenarios are considered, such as a cut-in \cite{xu2002effects, gietelink2006development,roesener2017comprehensive}, braking of a predecessor \cite{xu2002effects,deGelder2017assessment,hulshof2013autonomous}, a near miss \cite{gietelink2006development}, a collision or a safety-critical scenario \cite{gietelink2006development,ebner2011identifying}, an urban scenario \cite{zofka2015datadrivetrafficscenarios}, a free-driving or vehicle-following scenario \cite{roesener2017comprehensive}, a lane change \cite{roesener2017comprehensive}, an overtaking \cite{karaduman2013interactivebehavior}, a platoon merge \cite{englund2016grand}, an intersection passing \cite{englund2016grand}, a highway lane reduction \cite{ploeg2017GCDC}, or urban intersection crossing \cite{ploeg2017GCDC}. In order to get a complete picture of all scenarios that are encountered in traffic, this list of scenarios should be expanded. However, when doing this, the following problems occur:

% Problems: not mutually exclusive, not complete, depends
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The scenario classes are not mutually exclusive, so it is unclear how a scenario should be classified. For example, a scenario in which a predecessor brakes can be both a braking scenario and an urban scenario. \label{item:mutual exclusiveness}
	\item It might be difficult to determine whether the list of scenarios is complete. A more structured approach is necessary for this. \label{item:completeness}
	\item There is a balance between general scenario classes - and thus a high variety - and specific scenario classes - and thus not much variety. For example, for some systems one is interested in cut-in scenarios on highways, while for another system one might be interested in cut-in scenarios on all road types. \label{item:generality}
\end{enumerate}

% Solution
The proposed solution is to provide tree structure of tags that describe the scenario. A tag could be something that describes the weather, the type of road or a specific activity of a target vehicle, etc. The tags are structured according to different trees, see Figure~\ref{fig:tag trees} for four examples. Tags that are in the same layer or tags that are in different branches are mutually exclusive. For example, regarding the weather (Figure~\ref{fig:tag trees}a), it is not possible to have a scenario in which there is rain and snow at the same time. The different layers of the trees can be regarded as different abstraction levels \cite{Bonnin2014}. 

The trees provide the possibility to define specific tags, while these specific tags belong to a more generic tag. For example, when examining the following behavior of an automated vehicle, one might want to test for all vehicle-following scenarios (see Figure~\ref{fig:tag trees}b), while in another case one might want to only test for the vehicle-following scenarios with braking involved when testing the braking capability of the automated system in a vehicle-following scenario.

Note that the tags assigned to the scenario may depend on the ego vehicle. For example, the `target in front' refers to the vehicle in front of the ego vehicle.
