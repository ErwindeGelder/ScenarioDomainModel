% Explain what an ontology is and refer to summary of this paper
According to Gruber \cite{gruber1993ontology}, an ontology is an ``explicit specification of a conceptualization''. As such, in this paper, several concepts are specified and its relations are further detailed. A summary of the ontology is presented in Table~\ref{tab:ontology}. The characteristics of the terms \emph{scenario class}, \emph{scenario}, \emph{event}, and \emph{activity} are shown in the second column of Table~\ref{tab:ontology}. The third column of the table shows the relation between the terms and other concepts. For example, a scenario class refers to multiple scenarios and a scenario contains one or multiple events and activities.

% Explain section
First, the context for which this paper describes the ontology is presented in Section~\ref{sec:context}. In Section~\ref{sec:scenario definition}, definitions of scenarios from literature are discussed. Based on this, the main features of a scenario are concluded. Finally, a definition of the term \emph{scenario} is given. A discussion on the scenario classes is provided in Section~\ref{sec:scenario classes}. The definition of the term \emph{event} is presented in Section~\ref{sec:events}.
