% Explain section
This section details the notion of \emph{scenario}. First, the context for which this paper describes the ontology is described in Section~\ref{sec:context}. In Section~\ref{sec:scenario definition}, a definition of the term \emph{scenario} is given such that it is in line with existing definitions and it suits the context of real-life driving data. Next, a discussion on the scenario classes is provided. As presented in Section~\ref{sec:scenario definition}, a scenario consists of events. The definition of an event is presented in Section~\ref{sec:events}. Section~\ref{sec:nomenclature} provides the meanings of other terms that are introduced in Section~\ref{sec:scenario definition}.
