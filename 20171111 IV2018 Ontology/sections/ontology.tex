% Explain what an ontology is and refer to summary of this paper
According to Gruber \cite{gruber1993ontology}, an ontology is an ``explicit specification of a conceptualization''. As such, in this paper, several concepts are specified and its relations are further detailed. A summary of the ontology is presented in Table~\ref{tab:ontology}.

\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
		\caption{Summary of the ontology presented in this paper.}
		\label{tab:ontology}
		\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{p{3em} X X}
			\toprule
			Term & Characteristics & ``has'' \\ \otoprule
			Scenario class & Qualitative description of scenario & Scenarios \newline Other (less generic) scenario classes \newline One or multiple tags \\
			Scenario & Quantitative description \newline Time interval & One or multiple events \newline One or multiple activities \newline Ego vehicle \newline Static environment \newline Dynamic environment \\
			Event & Time instant \newline Mode transition (i.e. change of input, parameter or state) & \\
			Activity & Inter-event time interval \newline Quantitative description of (changing) state & Model that describes the way the state evolves \\

% Explain section
First, the context for which this paper describes the ontology is described in Section~\ref{sec:context}. In Section~\ref{sec:scenario definition}, a definition of the term \emph{scenario} is given. Next, a discussion on the scenario classes is provided. As presented in Section~\ref{sec:scenario definition}, a scenario consists of events. The definition of an event is presented in Section~\ref{sec:events}.
