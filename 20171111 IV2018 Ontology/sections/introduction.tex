\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% For validating all traffic scenarios
An important aspect in the development of automated vehicles (AVs) is the assessment of the safety, comfort and efficiency of the AVs \cite{bengler2014threedecades, stellet2015taxonomy, Helmer2017safety, putz2017pegasus, roesener2017comprehensive, gietelink2006development}. For legal and public acceptance, it is important that there is a clear definition of system performance and quantitative measures for the system performance. For the assessment, the scenarios that are used for the assessment, i.e. the test cases, are crucial \cite{stellet2015taxonomy}. This paper proposes an ontology for these \emph{scenarios}.

% Explain importance/relevance
The notion of scenario is frequently used in the context of automated driving, despite the fact an explicit definition is often not provided \cite{putz2017pegasus, roesener2017comprehensive, gietelink2006development, hulshof2013autonomous, karaduman2013interactivebehavior, englund2016grand, xu2002effects, ebner2011identifying, ploeg2017GCDC, zofka2015datadrivetrafficscenarios}. However, using a scenario in the context of the development or assessment of AVs requires a clear definition of a scenario \cite{stellet2015taxonomy, Helmer2017safety, alvarez2017prospective, zofka2015datadrivetrafficscenarios, aparicio2013pre, lesemann2011test, putz2017pegasus, geyer2014, ulbrich2015}. To this end, few definitions of a scenario in the context of (automated) driving have been proposed \cite{geyer2014, ulbrich2015, elrofai2016scenario}.

% What is the added value of this paper w.r.t. other work
% - Easier to apply event/scenario mining, because more concrete
% - Important step towards quantification of completeness
% - More complete (also event defined etc.)
% - Backed up with literature (should we mention this???)
% - Real example given
We aim for a definition of a scenario that is, on the one hand, broadly consistent with existing definitions \cite{geyer2014, ulbrich2015, elrofai2016scenario} while, on the other hand, more concrete, such that it is applicable for scenario mining \cite{elrofai2016scenario} and scenario-based assessment \cite{stellet2015taxonomy, deGelder2017assessment}. We provide a more concrete definition by defining quantitative building blocks of scenarios in the form of activities and events. An example is provided which demonstrates the use of the ontology with a real-world scenario.

% Outline
The outline of the paper is as follows. Section~\ref{sec:nomenclature} specifies notions that are adopted from literature to define a scenario. Section~\ref{sec:ontology} describes the ontology of real-world scenarios in the context of automated driving. First, a definition of a \emph{scenario} is provided, then the more abstract and generic concept of \emph{scenario classes} is explained. In Section~\ref{sec:example}, an application example is provided to demonstrate the use of the ontology with a real-world scenario. 
The paper is concluded in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
