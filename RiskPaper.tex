\begin{abstract}
	
	
New developments in the automotive industry towards higher levels of automation are introducing new safety concerns for vehicles. Test procedures and performance measures need to be adapted to evaluate vehicles with automated driving systems. To accommodate this, risk assessment methods in the automotive domain, such as described in the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) in ISO~26262:2018, are developed. The state of the art of risk assessment methods, such as the aforementioned HARA, has a qualitative nature and does not capture the complexity of a driving scenario. In this paper, we introduce a method for risk analysis and quantification of a driving scenario.

We consider risk to be the product of severity of the outcome of a scenario and probability of that scenario.
For severity, we adopt the same metric as in HARA, but we introduce a systematic method for calculating the probability, where we assume a causal relation between the activities and events that constitute a scenario. 
By making educated assumptions
% , based on expert judgment, --> Don't need to say this, because "educated" implies the same, right?
on the dependencies among the different activities, events, and environmental conditions, we simplify the calculation of the probability of a scenario. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are employed for computing the probability of an outcome of a scenario.

Using our proposed method, we can compare safety criticality of various scenarios in an quantitative manner. This can lead to stronger justification for design decisions and test coverage for developing automated vehicle functionalities. 
For illustrating how the proposed method can be used in practice, we perform a case study by applying our proposed method for risk analysis of a cut-in scenario.

%% No need to mention the challenges in the abstract
% The challenge for applying this method is gathering enough data for quantification of scenario activities.
