% Introduction
%New developments in the automotive industry towards higher levels of automation are introducing new safety concerns for vehicles. Test procedure and performance measures need to be adapted for evaluation of vehicles with an Automated Driving (AD) system. The safety and reliability of the AD vehicles must be validated in principle for all possible traffic situations/scenarios that ADS may encounter on the road, before these systems can be taken into production.

Recent innovations such as automated driving and smart mobility have elevated the safety-criticality of automotive systems due to the impact of these technologies in the traffic behavior and safety. New safety validation and assessment methodologies are required to provide the level of assurance that matches the societal impact of these systems.
The objective of this paper is to introduce a novel method for assessment and quantification of the risk of a driving scenario taking into account the operational design domain. 
For our proposed method, we assume that a scenario consists of activities (performed by different actors) and environmental conditions that leads to a potentially hazardous consequence.
The risk of a driving scenario is the product of the probability of the exposure of a scenario and the severity of the hazardous consequence of that scenario.
We introduce a systematic method for calculating the probability of exposure, 
	where we assume a causal relation between the activities that constitute a scenario. 
By making educated assumptions on the dependencies among the different activities and environmental conditions, 
	we simplify the calculation of the probability of the exposure. 
For estimating the severity, we employ Monte Carlo simulations.
% Results
We illustrate the use of our proposed method by applying it to an example of a collision avoidance system in a cut-in scenario.	
We use naturalistic driving data acquired from field studies on the Dutch highways to determine the risk. 
% Discussion and limitations
The presented example illustrates the potential of our proposed risk estimation method. 
% Conclusion
Using our proposed method, we can compare the safety criticality of various scenarios in a quantitative manner, which can be used as a safety metric for evaluating automated driving systems. 
This can lead to stronger justification for design decisions and test coverage for developing automated vehicle functionalities. 


%% No need to mention the challenges in the abstract
%%% Arash: This is required from the ESV to discuss the limitations. I think it's beacause this is more like an extended asbtact. 
% The challenge for applying this method is gathering enough data for quantification of scenario activities.
