\begin{abstract}
New developments in the automotive industry towards higher levels of automation is introducing new safety concerns for vehicles. 
The role of scenario in defining the functionality and safety of the automated vehicles is becoming significant. 
The state of art of risk assessment methods in the automotive domain (as described in Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) in ISO~26262:2018) have a qualitative nature and does not to capture the complexity of a driving scenario. 	
In this paper we introduce a method for risk analysis and quantification of a driving scenario.

\color{red}
TODO: Explain how this risk estimation works. 

We consider risk to be the product of severity of the outcome of a scenario and probability of that scenario.
For severity, we adopt the same metric as in HARA, but we introduce a systematic method for calculating the probability. 
In this method, we assume a causal relation between the activities and events that construct a scenario. 
By making educated assumptions based on expert judgment, we breakdown the probability calculation for the dependent and independent activities/events as well as environmental conditions. 

TODO: Explain the role of Monte Carlo simulation in this calculation. 

The environmental conditions are considered static and therefore we only require knowledge on the probability density function of the conditions to calculate their probability. 
On the other hand, the activities of a scenario are dynamic and have variations in the manner they happen. 
Therefore, we use Monte Carlo simulations on the parameterized scenario to calculate the portability of a sequence of activities of the scenario.  
\color{black}

We perform a case study by applying our proposed method for risk analysis of a cut-in scenario, and show how the method can be used in practice. 
Using our proposed method, we can compare safety criticality of various scenarios in an quantitative manner. 
This can lead to stronger justification for design decisions and test coverage for developing automated vehicle functionalities. 

\color{red}
The challenge for applying this method is gathering enough data for quantification of scenario activities.
