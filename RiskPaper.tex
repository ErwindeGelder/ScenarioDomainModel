New developments in the automotive industry towards higher levels of automation are introducing new safety concerns for vehicles. 
Test procedures and performance measures need to be adapted to evaluate vehicles with automated driving systems. 

TODO: Talk about the role of driving scenarios based on naturalistic data versus crash data. 

TODO: Mention that virtual testing is required. 

The state of the art risk assessment methods in the automotive domain, 
	such as the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) of ISO~26262:2018, 
	have a qualitative nature and rely on expert's judgment for ranking the severity and probability of risks.
More over, these methods are only capable of evaluating the risk of a single (hazardous) event 
	within the context of a generic operational situation.
Where as, for safety evaluation by virtual testing, we need the detailed description of driving scenarios including the operational situation
	as well as the description of actions and events of those scenarios. 

TODO: Explain what a scenario and it's parts are. 	
	

The objective of this paper is to introduce a method for risk analysis and quantification of a driving scenario.
Considering risk as the product of severity of the outcome of a scenario and probability of that scenario, 
	we focus on the quantification of the probability in this work. 
For severity, we adopt the same metric as in HARA, but we introduce a systematic method for calculating the probability, 
	where we assume a causal relation between the activities and events that constitute a scenario. 
By making educated assumptions on the dependencies among the different activities, events, and environmental conditions, 
	we simplify the calculation of the probability of a scenario. 
Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are employed for computing the probability of the outcome of scenarios.

To illustrate how the proposed method can be used in practice, 
	we perform a case study by applying our proposed method for risk analysis of a cut-in scenario.	

TODO: explain where we get our data. 

TODO: discuss the method and it's limitation. 
	
Using our proposed method, we can compare safety criticality of various scenarios in an quantitative manner. 
This can lead to stronger justification for design decisions and test coverage for developing automated vehicle functionalities. 

TODO: explain the relevance to the session. 


%% No need to mention the challenges in the abstract
%%% Arash: This is required from the ESV to discuss the limitations. I think it's beacause this is more like an extended asbtact. 
% The challenge for applying this method is gathering enough data for quantification of scenario activities.
