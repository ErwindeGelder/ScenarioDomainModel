\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We proposed a procedure for the assessment of an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) in order to answer the question ``What procedure could be used for the safety assessment of an AV by an independent assessor?''
In the proposed procedure, a distinction is made between activities of the applicant and the independent assessor, while considering the limited resources and the proprietary and confidential information related to the development of the AV.

There are still some open questions. E.g., how to assure that the set of tests cover the ODD and DDT sufficiently? Also, since virtual simulations seem inevitable, how to prove that the results of the virtual simulations alongside the limited number of physical tests provide a reliable evaluation of the AV?

Despite these open questions, the proposed procedure can be used as a starting point for discussions on the development of a legal framework for authorities for the safety assurance of AVs before deploying these vehicle on the public road.
