%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Brainstorm 20/01
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%1.  What is the relation between safe driving behavior and safety-KPIs as TTC/THW?
%2. Too scattered? More Focus?
%3. What is different in Journal vs Conference?
%4. Self-cite or rewrite and don't self-cite? (related: should it be about validating previous paper? Or have it as inclusive and extend?)
%5. Idea for later: Write paper on framework?
%6. Rough/Raw Title ideas:
% --- Validating unsupervised safe driving behavior modelling with safety KPI?
% --- Defining, modelling and validating safe driving behavior.
% --- Defining, modelling and validating safe and typical driving behavior.
% --- Defining, modelling and validating safe driving behavior based on "typical" human driving behavior.
% --- Characterizing safe driving behavior with unsupervised anomaly detection.
% --- Unsupervised anomaly detection to capture safe driving behavior.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Meeting 22/01
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% - main contribution is theory
% - second goal is from application-perspective
% - Erwin metric
% - analysis of results / validation
% --- 50-50 cross-validation within dataset (comparison with other KPIs)
% --- manual validation of results (instantaneous (all) vs build-up)
% --- experimental validation (StreetLive, to be done in a later stage - not within scope of this paper)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Inverse plot: Plot reconstruction errors of TTC < 1.5?
% Try with different sigma values? What to expect?
% Plot TTC distribution for different sigma bins?
% Don't do binary binning - but reconstruction error as ANOMALY metrics and plot vs TTC? (heatmap/scatter?)
% Can we prove point without giving a final anomaly yes/no

% ABSTRACT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% INTRODUCTION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1. Future Vision (Vehicle Automation)
% 2. Problem 
% --- What is "Safe Driving"?
% --- Not much traffic accident data?
% 3. Focus 
% --- Safe Driving Characterization based on "Typical" Behavior
% --- Unsupervised AI models to capture "typical" driving behavior
% --- "Anomalous" behavior should be the superset of safety KPI ? ("Anomalous" should be more severe)
% 4. Approach
% --- Model naturalistic driving behavior (highway-longitudinal only)
% --- Multiple datasets (USA & Dutch)
% --- Validate Hypothesis
% 5. Paper Organisation

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% RELATED WORK
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1. Safe Driving Behavior
% 2. Safety Metrics/KPI
% --- TTC and related (CPM/Severity?)
% --- THW
% --- CPM_DRAC
% --- ErwinEtAl.
% --- Wang&Mastialis (spelling)
% 3. Modelling Behavior with unsupervised AI
% --- Anomaly Detection?
% --- supervised vs unsupervised?
% --- Autoencoders

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% METHOD
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1. Safe Driving Behavior
% --- Motivation and Definition (AVs should display  a  driving  behavior  that  is  recognized  as  predictable and safe by all road users)
% --- Typical traffic interactions (motivation & reasoning)
% --- How to model? How to validate? (no ground truth) - Introduce hypothesis!!
% 2. Modelling Safe Driving Behavior
% --- Unsupervised
% --- Autoencoder

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1. Dataset
% --- NGSIM
% --- Motorway_Turbulence
% 2. Longitudinal Interactions
% 3. Autoencoder (hyper)parameters, architecture & anomaly threshold?
% 4. KPI

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Results
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1. Plots & ..
% 2. ..Statistics (% in each group, % severe in each group?)
% 3. (Optinal) Autocorrelations? (What does it add?)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Discussion
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1. Anomalies from AE tend to be more severe
% 2. Anomalies from AE superset of multiple KPI?
% 3. superset of KPI + including 'weird' behavior = safe driving behavior modelling?
% 4. Problem remains: no ground truth, and anomalous by definition is more than just 'unsafe', it's "unexpected"

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Conclusion
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1. First attempt at trying to validate safe driving behavior based on typical driving behavior by comparing with safety critical metrics?
