* p.2 , II.Background, B: redefinition of AVs (was already done in the 1st paragraph of I.Introduction)

* p.2 , II.Background, C: 1st paragraph: Where exactly are the concepts ego vehicle, actor, state, model, mode, activity, static environment, and dynamic environment originating from? They're popping up for the first time here and need a proper reference.

* p.4, Definition 1: Why are you generalizing at this point? Here, the scenario definition is derived (and inverted) from the specific use-case of recording scenarios from real-world data.
For a (qualitative) scenario description in AV testing, the behavior of an Ego as the SUT is definitely not quantitatively described within the scenario.
Moreover, in most cases, the static environment is referenced by the scenario description, but not part of it. To be more precise, I’d write “the scenario describes the dynamic parts of the virtual world while it references the static parts of the virtual world”. This is potentially affecting the rest of the paper.

* p.4, III Definitions, A: The introduction of the term "scenario class" for qualitative scenarios implies a one-way inheritance relationship between qualitative and quantitative scenarios.
I personally prefer a bidirectional approach.

* p.4, Fig.1 & explanation: Figure 1 is showing an "overview of a scenario".
It is indicated by color, but not explicitely mentioned that a description of the ego-vehicle is optional and that static content is usually referenced from other data.

* p.4, Definition 2: The role of conditions is somehow blurred in the event definition and the following paragraphs. I'd recommend to either replace the term event by "trigger" or to clearly separate event and conditions (e.g. by referencing the introduction of conditions on page 9 here).

* p.5, C. Activity: The first chapter states "As mentioned in Definition 1, a scenario is a description of the dynamic environment of the ego vehicle".
Even though this would be my idea of a scenario, this phrase is conflicting with the definition above.

* p.5 C. Activity, last chapter: "the lateral position of a vehicle with respect to the center of the road".
Those maneuvers are usually referenced to the center of the corresponding lanes. Only implicitely, they're referended to the center of the road.

 * p.5 D.Scenario class: The first paragraph states:  "As proposed above, a scenario in the context of the
performance assessment of an AV needs to be quantitative". I didn't find the actual paragraph where this happened.

* p.4 Definition 4: See remarks on Definition 1.

* p.4-5, explanation of scenario classes: While scenario classes where introduced as abstract, qualitative scenario description (i.e. a high-level description language) before,the y're now reduced to simple tags (day, rain,...). Is this intended here? 

* p.7 A: Domain model: Again, the first paragraphs and the figure illustrate the integration of the static environment within the scenario.
This is somehow conflicting with the above mentioned paragraphs on p.5

* p.8, Fig. 4: I'm missing an outline for the "dynamic environonment" in this figure.

* p.9, 2nd paragraph: 1st reference to OpenSCENARIO, without mentioning it. I'd expect this a little earlier and more prominent.
