	% Explain issue: assessment is important
	The development of assessment methods for the performance of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is essential to enable and speed up the deployment of automated driving technologies, due to the complex operational domain of AVs.
	% Introduce scenarios (for assessment)
	As traditional methods for assessing vehicles are not applicable for AVs, other approaches have been proposed. 
	Among these, real-world scenario-based assessment is widely supported by many players in the automotive field. 
	In this approach, test cases are derived from real-world scenarios that are obtained from driving data.
	
	% Problem -> definition needed for scenario
	To minimize any ambiguity regarding these test cases and scenarios, a clear definition of the notion of scenario is required.
	\cstartb An intensional definition that provides a set of characteristics that are deemed to be both necessary and sufficient to qualify as a scenario could help to assure that the scenarios constructed are both complete and intercomparable.
	% Solution: concrete definitions
	In this paper, we develop a comprehensive and operable definition of scenario by bringing together existing definitions in the literature.
	This is achieved by proposing an object-oriented framework for defining a scenario and its qualitative and quantitative building blocks. \cendb
	% Example
	An example illustrates that the presented \cstartb framework \cendb is applicable for scenario-based assessment of AVs.
