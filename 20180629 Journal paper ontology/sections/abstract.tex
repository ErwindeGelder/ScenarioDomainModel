	% Explain issue: assessment is important
	The development of assessment methods for the performance of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is essential to enable and speed up the deployment of automated driving technologies, due to the complex operational domain of AVs.
	% Introduce scenarios (for assessment)
	As traditional methods for assessing vehicles are not applicable for AVs, other approaches have been proposed. 
	Among these, real-world scenario-based assessment is widely supported by many players in the automotive field. 
	In this approach, test cases are derived from real-world scenarios that are obtained from driving data.
	
	% Problem -> definition needed for scenario
	To minimize any ambiguity regarding these test cases and scenarios, a clear definition of the notion of scenario is required.
	% Solution: concrete definitions
	In this paper, we propose a more concrete definition of scenario, compared to what is known to the authors from the literature. This is achieved by proposing an \cstartb object-oriented framework for defining a scenario and its quantitative building\cendb.
	% Example
	An example illustrates that the presented \cstartb framework \cendb is applicable for scenario-based assessment of AVs.
