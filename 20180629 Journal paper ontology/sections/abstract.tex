	% Explain issue: assessment is important
	\cbstartc
	The development of assessment methods for the performance of Automated Vehicles (AVs) is essential to enable and speed up the deployment of AVs' technologies, due to the complex operational domain of AVs. 
	% Introduce scenarios (for assessment)
	As traditional methods for approving vehicles are not applicable for AVs, other approaches have been proposed. 
	Real-world scenario-based assessment is proposed among other approaches and widely supported by many players in the automotive field. 
	In this approach, test cases are derived from real-world scenarios that are obtained from driving data.
	\cbend
	% Problem -> definition needed for scenario
	To minimize any ambiguity regarding these test cases and scenarios, a clear definition of the notion of scenario is required.
	% Solution: concrete definitions
	In this paper, we propose a more concrete definition of scenario, compared to what is known to the authors from the literature. This is achieved by proposing an ontology in which the quantitative building blocks of a scenario are defined.
	% Example
	An example illustrates that the presented ontology is applicable for scenario-based assessment of AVs.
