\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The performance assessment of AVs is important for the legal and public acceptance of AVs. 
Since scenarios for testing are crucial for the assessment, a clear definition of a scenario is required within this context. 
We have proposed a new definition of a scenario in the context of the assessment of the quality of an AV. 
The definition states that a scenario is a quantitative description of the ego vehicle, its activities and/or goals, its static environment and its dynamic environment. 
The attributes of a scenario are further specified in the proposed ontology.
The ontology is illustrated with an example.
The presented ontology is applicable for scenario mining and scenario-based assessment and therefore, this paper provides a step towards the scenario-based performance assessment of AVs.
