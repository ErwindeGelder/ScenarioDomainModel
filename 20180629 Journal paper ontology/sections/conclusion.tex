\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The performance assessment of AVs is essential for the legal and public acceptance of AVs as well as for technology development of AVs. 
A clear definition of a scenario is required, because scenarios are crucial for the assessment.
In this work, we have proposed a new definition of a scenario in the context of the assessment of the performance of an AV. 
\cbstartc While our definition is consistent with other definitions from the literature, it is more concrete such that it can directly be implemented using code.
The definition states that a scenario is a quantitative description of the ego vehicle, its activities and/or goals, its static environment, and its dynamic environment. 
We have further defined the notions of event, activity, and scenario class. Events and activities are the building blocks for a scenario and a scenario class is an abstraction of a scenario.

To formalize the definitions of a scenario, an event, an activity, and a scenario class, an ontology has been proposed. Using the proposed ontology, it is possible to describe a scenario in both a qualitative and quantitative manner. The ontology, represented using a domain model, can be directly translated into a class structure for an object-oriented software implementation. This allows us to translate scenarios into code, such that both domain experts and software programs, such as simulation tools, are able to understand the content of the scenarios. 

\cbstart
The ontology has been illustrated with an example of an urban scenario with a pedestrian crossing. 
%In the example, the ego vehicle was approaching a pedestrian crossing while a pedestrian wanted to cross the road using the pedestrian crossing. In this scenario, the ego vehicle was braking to let the pedestrian cross the road. 
We also demonstrated how this particular scenario can be used as a test case. In addition, we showed how this test case can be represented using the proposed ontology.

The presented ontology is applicable for scenario mining \cite{paardekooper2019dataset6000km} and scenario-based assessment \cite{elrofai2018scenario} and, therefore, this paper provides a step towards the scenario-based performance assessment of AVs. The next step is to define scenarios and scenario classes\footnote{\cbstart In \cite{degelder2019scenarioclasses}, we already defined 56 scenario classes for Singapore.\cbend} that are relevant for an AV in a specific deployment area. Furthermore, based on the scenarios, proper tests can be defined to assess the performance of AVs.
