Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is often used to estimate a probability density function (pdf).
Drawing random sampling from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the need of evaluating the actual pdf, which make it suitable for drawing random samples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods.
A conditional probability (density) is the probability (density) of an event, given that another event has already occurred.
With conditional sampling, the goal is to generate samples from such a conditional probability density.

In this paper, we provide a method to sample from a conditional pdf in case the pdf is estimated using KDE. 
In addition, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE, such that the samples satisfy linear constraints. 
We present the algorithms of our methods in pseudo code. 
Furthermore, through an example, we illustrate the performance of the presented methods.
