The assessment of \acp{av} is an important aspect in order to develop \acp{av}.
A scenario-based approach is accepted by many players in the field.
One way to generate the scenarios for the scenario-based assessment, is to parameterize the scenarios and to draw these parameters from \iac{pdf}.
To be flexible with the underlying distribution of these parameters, \ac{kde} is a promising candidate for estimated the underlying \ac{pdf}.
Drawing random sampling from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the need of evaluating the actual pdf, which make it suitable for drawing random samples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods.

In this paper, we provide a method to sample from a conditional pdf in case the pdf is estimated using KDE. 
In addition, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE, such that the samples satisfy linear constraints. 
We present the algorithms of our methods in pseudo code. 
Furthermore, through an example, we illustrate the performance of the presented methods by generating braking scenarios that have, e.g., a predetermined starting speed.
Because our methods do not evaluate the actual (conditional) \ac{pdf}, it is efficient in terms of computational costs.
