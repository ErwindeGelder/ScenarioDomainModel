\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

It is expected that scenarios become more and more important for the assessment of \acp{av}. 
One way to generate these scenarios is to sample their parameters from \iac{pdf} that is estimated using \ac{kde}. 
In this paper, we have shown how these parameters can be drawn from the estimated \ac{pdf} while these parameters are subject to linear equality constraints. 
Through an example, we have illustrated the effectiveness of our method by generating braking scenarios with a fixed mean deceleration and a fixed start or end speed. 

Future work involves applying this method to generate more complex scenarios for the assessment of \acp{av}.
Of particular interest would be to investigate the use of our proposed method in combination with a parameter reduction method like \ac{pca}.
