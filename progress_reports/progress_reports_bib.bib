  abstract = {Activities in the field of automated driving have produced a variety
	of development tools and methodologies over the past decades. The
	requirements the systems have to fulfil and thus also the development
	guidelines are often documented in different kinds of catalogues
	(use-case catalogues, situation catalogues, scenario catalogues etc.).
	These catalogues cannot be directly applied for the development of
	partially and highly automated vehicle guidance concepts like conduct-by-wire
	(CbW) or H-mode. One reason is that up to now, no consistent terminology
	known to the authors yet exists for vehicle automation within the
	community. Moreover, as the aim of the two project groups CbW and
	H-mode is to make a comprehensive feasibility assessment of cooperative
	vehicle guidance, all interacting components of the overall system
	as well as all potential driving conditions a cooperative vehicle
	guidance system might have to cope with have to be analysed. This
	article focuses on two aspects. The first is a metaphor-based terminology
	discussion leading to a proposal for a fundamental ontology. The
	second aspect is an outlook on the different catalogues that use
	the new terminology and that have been developed. The methodology
	introduced here is a fundamental contribution towards simplifying
	communication and the exchange of findings.},

  abstract  = {For the design and test of functional modules of an automated vehicle,
	it is essential to define interfaces. While interfaces on the perception
	side, like object lists, point clouds or occupancy grids, are to
	a certain degree settled already, they are quite vague in the consecutive
	steps of context modeling and in particular on the side of driving
	execution. The authors consider the scene as the central interface
	between perception and behavior planning & control. Within the behavior
	planning & control block, a situation is a central data container.
	A scenario is a common approach to substantiate test cases for functional
	modules and can be used to detail the functional description of a
	system. However, definitions of these terms are often-at best-vague
	or even contradictory. This paper will review these definitions and
	come up with a consistent definition for each term. Moreover, we
	present an example for the implementation of each of these interfaces.},
