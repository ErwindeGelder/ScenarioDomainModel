  abstract  = {More and more Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADASs) are entering
	the market for improving both safety and comfort. Adaptive Cruise
	Control (ACC) is an ADAS application that has high interaction with
	the driver. ACC systems use limited sensor input and have only few
	configuration possibilities. This may result in the behaviour of
	the ACC not matching user's preferences in all cases, resulting in
	lower acceptance of the system. In this work, we examine the possibilities
	for a Personalised ACC (PACC), which adapts the ACC settings such
	that it matches the driver preference in order to increase the acceptance.
	The driver preferred ACC behaviour is predicted using machine learning
	techniques and manual driving data. On-road experiments showed that
	the method is promising as it is able to discriminate between two
	preference clusters with an accuracy of 85\%.},
