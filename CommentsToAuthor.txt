Comments to author (Associate Editor)
=====================================

Dear authors, 

Please review your manuscript carefully following with the
reviewers' comments.

# reviewer 1
The authors present a useful novelty prediction method that
can be used for autonomous driving systems. However, the
authors need to strengthen its relationship with
intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications. 
1. Since it’s ITSC, I would strongly recommend including a
bit more materials about how the proposed method can be
applied to intelligent transportation systems and other
relevant background in the introduction section. 
2. In addition, the authors should cite more relevant ITS
papers. 
3. Since the paper is motivated with autonomous driving
context, the experiment should also use relevant datasets.
Some datasets do not look quite relevant. 
I don't have any comments regarding methodology since it's
mostly based on the existing work. 

#Reviewer 2

In this paper, a new method for mining scenarios from
real-world driving data are proposed. The research topic is
meaningful and interesting. Research method is appropriate,
and results get support from data validation.
