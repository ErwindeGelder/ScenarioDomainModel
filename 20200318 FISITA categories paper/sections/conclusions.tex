\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

% Mention that the scenario categories and tags can be used to define an ODD.
The performance assessment of AVs is essential for the legal and public acceptance of AVs as well as for technology development of AVs. 
Scenarios are crucial for the assessment. We proposed a system of tags to group these scenarios into so-called scenario categories. Because the tags are structured in trees, it is possible to define both generic scenario categories and more specific scenario categories.

We have also discussed the relation between scenarios and test cases. For the definition of test cases for the assessment of an AV, it is important to consider the AV's ODD. Currently, there is no unambiguous method known to the authors for the definition of an ODD. A promising method to describe the ODD is using scenario categories. Defining the scenario categories belonging to the AV's ODD according to the proposed method using the system of tags will reduce --- if not remove -- any ambiguity regarding the AV's ODD.

We aimed to provide an extensive list of tags. However, depending on the application, the list of tags might not be extensive enough. Therefore, we will release subsequent versions of the report \autocite{degelder2019scenariocategories} in which more tags might be added.
