	an introduced lane-related coordinate system together with individual
	occupancy schedule grids for all modeled vehicles. This combination
	allows an efficient classification of the existing vehicle-lane and
	vehicle- vehicle relations in traffic scenes and thus substantially
	improves the understanding of complex traffic scenes. Probabilities
	and variances within the network are propagated systematically which
	results in probabilistic sets of the modeled driving maneuvers. Using
	this generic approach, the network is able to classify a total of
	27 driving maneuvers including merging and object following.},

	and future perspectives of driver assistance systems. Mobility is
	a fundamental desire of mankind. Virtually any society strives for
	safe and efficient mobility at low ecological and economic costs.
	Nevertheless, its technical implementation significantly differs
	among societies, depending on their culture and their degree of industrialization.
	A potential evolutionary roadmap for driver assistance systems is
	discussed. Emerging from systems based on proprioceptive sensors,
	such as ABS or ESC, we review the progress incented by the use of
	exteroceptive sensors such as radar, video, or lidar. While the ultimate
	goal of automated and cooperative traffic still remains a vision
	of the future, intermediate steps towards that aim can be realized
	through systems that mitigate or avoid collisions in selected driving
	situations. Research extends the state-of-the-art in automated driving
	in urban traffic and in cooperative driving, the latter addressing
	communication and collaboration between different vehicles, as well
	as cooperative vehicle operation by its driver and its machine intelligence.
	These steps are considered important for the interim period, until
	reliable unsupervised automated driving for all conceivable traffic
	situations becomes available. The prospective evolution of driver
	assistance systems will be stimulated by several technological, societal
	and market trends. The paper closes with a view on current research
	fields.},

	saw vision guided autonomous vehicles, which was a major milestone
	in technology and till date we use similar or modified forms of vision

	in modern cars such as lane keeping, automatic braking and adaptive
	cruise control are based on such systems. Extensive network guided
	systems in conjunction with vision guided features is the future
	of autonomous vehicles. It is predicted that most companies will
	launch fully autonomous vehicles by the advent of next decade. The
	future of autonomous vehicles is an ambitious era of safe and comfortable
