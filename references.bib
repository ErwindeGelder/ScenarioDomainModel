	multivariate data, which exhibit complex patterns of dependence in
	the tails, can be modelled using a cascade of pair-copulae, acting
	on two variables at a time. We use the pair-copula decomposition
	of a general multivariate distribution and propose a method for performing
	inference. The model construction is hierarchical in nature, the
	various levels corresponding to the incorporation of more variables
	in the conditioning sets, using pair-copulae as simple building blocks.
	Pair-copula decomposed models also represent a very flexible way
	to construct higher-dimensional copulae. We apply the methodology
	to a financial data set. Our approach represents the first step towards
	the development of an unsupervised algorithm that explores the space
	of possible pair-copula models, that also can be applied to huge
	data sets automatically.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Practical applications of nonparametric density estimators
	in more than three dimensions suffer a great deal from the well-known
	curse of dimensionality: convergence slows down as dimension increases.
	We show that one can evade the curse of dimensionality by assuming
	a simplified vine copula model for the dependence between variables.
	We formulate a general nonparametric estimator for such a model and
	show under high-level assumptions that the speed of convergence is
	independent of dimension. We further discuss a particular implementation
	for which we validate the high-level assumptions and establish asymptotic
	normality. Simulation experiments illustrate a large gain in finite
	sample performance when the simplifying assumption is at least approximately
	true. But even when it is severely violated, the vine copula based
	approach proves advantageous as soon as more than a few variables
	are involved. Lastly, we give an application of the estimator to
	a classification problem from astrophysics.},
