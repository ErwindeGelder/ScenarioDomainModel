  abstract  = {This article introduces a novel approach towards the recognition of
	typical driving maneuvers in structured highway scenarios and shows
	some key benefits of traffic scene modeling with object-oriented
	Bayesian networks (OOBNs). The approach exploits the advantages of
	an introduced lane-related coordinate system together with individual
	occupancy schedule grids for all modeled vehicles. This combination
	allows an efficient classification of the existing vehicle-lane and
	vehicle- vehicle relations in traffic scenes and thus substantially
	improves the understanding of complex traffic scenes. Probabilities
	and variances within the network are propagated systematically which
	results in probabilistic sets of the modeled driving maneuvers. Using
	this generic approach, the network is able to classify a total of
	27 driving maneuvers including merging and object following.},
